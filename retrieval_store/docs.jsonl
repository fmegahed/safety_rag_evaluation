PolyScope Overview\nDescription\nPolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates\nthe robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in\nPolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:\n• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.\n• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.\n• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.\nUsing the\nTouch\nScreen\nThe touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent\nunexpected motion of the robot.\nThe Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike\nconsumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to\nenvironmental factors such as:\n• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets\n• radio wave emissions\n• other conducted noise from the operating environment.\nFor best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.\nIn this manual, this is referred to as a \"tap\".\nA commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.\n\n2.4.1.

{"text": "4. Risk Assessment\nDescription\nThe risk assessment is a requirement that shall be performed for the application. The\napplication risk assessment is the responsibility of the integrator. The user can also be\nthe integrator.\nThe robot is partly completed machinery, as such the safety of the robot application\ndepends on the tool/end effector, obstacles and other machines. The party performing\nthe integration must use ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 to conduct the risk assessment.\nTechnical Specification ISO/TS 15066 can provide additional guidance for collaborative\napplications. The risk assessment shall consider all tasks throughout the lifetime of the\nrobot application, including but not limited to:\n• Teaching the robot during set-up and development of the robot application\n• Troubleshooting and maintenance\n• Normal operation of the robot application\nA risk assessment must be conducted before the robot application is powered on for the\nfirst time. The risk assessment is an iterative process. After physically installing the\nrobot, verify the connections, then complete the integration. A part of the risk\nassessment is to determine the safety configuration settings, as well as the need for\nadditional emergency stops and/or other protective measures required for the specific\nrobot application.\n\nSafety\nconfiguration\nsettings\nIdentifying the correct safety configuration settings is a particularly important part of\ndeveloping robot applications. Unauthorized access to the safety configuration must be\nprevented by enabling and setting password protection.\nWARNING\nFailure to set password protection can result in injury or death due to\npurposeful or inadvertent changes to configuration settings.\n• Always set password protection.\n• Set up a program for managing passwords, so that access is\nonly by persons who understand the effect of changes.\nSome safety functions are purposely designed for collaborative robot applications.\nThese are configurable through the safety configuration settings. They are used to\naddress risks identified in the application risk assessment.\nThe following limit the robot and as such can affect the energy transfer to a person by\nthe robot arm, end effector and workpiece.\n• Force and power limiting: Used to reduce clamping forces and pressures\nexerted by the robot in the direction of movement in case of collisions between\nthe robot and the operator.\n• Momentum limiting: Used to reduce high transient energy and impact forces in\ncase of collisions between robot and operator by reducing the speed of the robot.\n• Speed limitation: Used to ensure the speed is less that the configured limit.\nThe following orientation settings are used to avoid movements and reduce exposure of\nsharp edges and protrusions to a person.\n• Joint, elbow and tool/end effector position limiting: Used to reduce risks\nassociated with certain body parts: Avoid movement towards head and neck.\n• Tool/end effector orientation limiting: Used to reduce risks associated with\ncertain areas and features of the tool/end effector and work-piece: Avoid sharp\nedges being pointed towards the operator, by turning the sharp edges inward\ntowards the robot.\nStopping\nperformance\nrisks\nSome safety functions are purposely designed for any robot application. These features\nare configurable through the safety configuration settings. They are used to address\nrisks associated with the stopping performance of the robot application.\nThe following limit the robot stopping time and stopping distance to ensure stopping will\noccur before reaching the configured limits. Both settings automatically affect the speed\nof the robot to ensure the limit is not exceeded.\n• Stopping Time Limit: Used to limit the stopping time of the robot.\n• Stopping Distance Limit: Used to limit the stopping distance of the robot.\nIf either of the above is used, there is no need for manually performed periodic stopping\nperformance testing. The robot safety control does continuous monitoring.\n\nIf the robot is installed in a robot application where hazards cannot be reasonably eliminated or\nrisks cannot be sufficiently reduced by use of the built-in safety-related functions (e.g. when\nusing a hazardous tool/end effector,or hazardous process), then safeguarding is required. See\nISO 10218-2.\nWARNING\nFailure to conduct a application risk assessment can increase risks.\n• Always conduct an application risk assessment for foreseeable risks\nand reasonably foreseeable misuse.\nFor collaborative applications, the risk assessment includes the\nforeseeable risks due to collisions and to reasonably foreseeable\nmisuse.\nThe risk assessment shall address:\n• Severity of harm\n• Likelihood of occurrence\n• Possibility to avoid the hazardous situation\nPotential\nHazards\nUniversal Robots identifies the potential significant hazards listed below for consideration\nby the integrator. Other significant hazards can be associated with a specific robot\napplication.\n• Penetration of skin by sharp edges and sharp points on tool/end effector or\ntool/end effector connector.\n• Penetration of skin by sharp edges and sharp points on nearby obstacles.\n• Bruising due to contact.\n• Sprain or bone fracture due to impact.\n• Consequences due to loose bolts that hold the robot arm or tool/end effector.\n• Items falling out of, or flying from the tool/end effector, e.g. due to a poor grip or\npower interruption.\n• Mistaken understanding of what is controlled by multiple emergency stop buttons.\n• Incorrect setting of the safety configuration parameters.\n• Incorrect settings due to unauthorized changes to the safety configuration\nparameters.\n4.1. Pinch Hazard\n\nDescription\nYou can avoid pinching hazards by removing obstacles in these areas, by placing the\nrobot differently, or by using a combination of safety planes and joint limits to eliminate\nthe hazards by preventing the robot moving into this area of its workspace.\nCAUTION\nPlacing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can\nlead to injury.\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require\nattention regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when\nthe wrist 1 joint is at least 750 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is\nwithin 200 mm of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.", "metadata": {"source": "004__L1__4._Risk_Assessment__pp33-36.pdf", "n_pages": 4}}

Workspace and Operating Space\nDescription\nThe workspace is the range of the fully extended robot arm, horizontally and vertically.\nThe operating space is the location where the robot is expected to function.\nNOTICE\nDisregard for the robot workspace and operating space can result in\nthe damage to property.\n• Consider the information below when choosing the operating\nspace for the robot.\nNOTICE\nMoving the tool close to the cylindrical volume can cause the joints to\nmove too fast, leading to loss of functionality and damage to property.\n• Do not move the tool close to the cylindrical volume, even when\nthe tool is moving slowly.\nWorkspace\nThe cylindrical volume is both directly above and directly below the robot base. The robot\nextends 850 mm from the base joint.\nFront\nTilted\n\n6.2. Dimensioning the Stand\nDimensioning\nthe Stand\nThe structure (stand) on which the robot arm is mounted is a crucial part of the robot\ninstallation. The stand must be sturdy and free of any vibrations from external sources.\nEach robot joint produces a torque that moves and stops the robot arm. During normal\nuninterrupted operation and during stopping motion, the joint torques are transferred to\nthe robot stand as:\n• Mz: Torque around the base z axis.\n• Fz: Forces along base z axis.\n• Mxy: Tilting torque in any direction of the base xy plane.\n• Fxy: Force in any direction in the base xy plane.\nDefinition of force and moment at the base flange.\n\nDimensionin\ng the Stand\nThe magnitude of the loads depends on robot model, program and multiple other factors.\nDimensioning of the stand shall account for the loads that the robot arm generates during\nnormal uninterrupted operation and during category 0, 1 and 2 stopping motion.\nDuring stopping motion, the joints are allowed to exceed the maximum nominal operating\ntorque. The load during stopping motion is independent of the stop category type.\nThe values stated in the following tables are maximum nominal loads in worst-case\nmovements multiplied with a safety factor of 2.5. The actual loads will not exceed these\nvalues.\nRobot Model\nMz [Nm]\nFz[N]\nMxy[Nm]\nFxy [N]\nUR5e\n450\n1090\n750\n910\nMaximum joint torques during category 0, 1 and 2 stops.\nRobot Model\nMz [Nm]\nFz[N]\nMxy[Nm]\nFxy [N]\nUR5e\n380\n950\n630\n750\nMaximum joint torques during normal operation.\nThe normal operating loads can generally be reduced by lowering the acceleration limits of\nthe joints. Actual operating loads are dependent on the application and robot program. You\ncan use URSim to evaluate the expected loads in your specific application.\n\nDimensioning\nthe Stand\nUsers have the option to incorporate added safety margins, factoring in the following\ndesign considerations:\n• Static stiffness: A stand that is not sufficiently stiff will deflect during robot motion,\nresulting in the robot arm not hitting the intended waypoint or path. Lack of static\nstiffness can also result in a poor freedrive teaching experience or protective\nstops.\n• Dynamic stiffness: If the eigenfrequency of the stand matches the movement\nfrequency of the robot arm, the entire system can resonate, creating the\nimpression that the robot arm is vibrating. Lack of dynamic stiffness can also\nresult in protective stops. The stand should have a minimum resonance frequency\nof 45 Hz.\n• Fatigue: The stand shall be dimensioned to match the expected operating lifetime\nand load cycles of the complete system.\nCAUTION\n• If the robot is mounted on an external axis, the accelerations of\nthis axis must not be too high. You can let the robot software\ncompensate for the acceleration of external axes by using the\nscript command set_base_acceleration()\n• High accelerations might cause the robot to make safety stops.\nWARNING\n• Potential for tip-over Hazards.\n• The robot arm's operational loads may cause movable\nplatforms, such as tables or mobile robots, to tip over, resulting\nin possible accidents.\n• Prioritize safety by implementing adequate measures to prevent\nthe tipping of movable platforms at all times.\n6.3. Mounting Description\nDescription\nRobot arm\n(Base)\nMounted with four 8.8 strength, 8.5 mm bolts and four M8 mounting holes\nat the base.\nTool (Tool\nFlange)\nUses four M6 thread holes for attaching a tool to the robot.

The robot\nmust not be operated in environments that exceed those\ncorresponding to the IP ratings of the robot (IP54), Teach Pendant\n(IP54) and Control Box (IP44)\nWarning:\nMounting\nWARNING\nUnstable mounting can lead to accidents.\n• Always make sure the robot parts are properly and securely\nmounted and bolted in place.\n6.3.1. Singularity Prevention\nDescription\nA singularity is a pose that restricts the motion and the ability to position the robot.\nThe robot arm can stop moving or have very sudden and fast movements if it approaches\na singularity. As the robot arm approaches a singularity position, resistance increases\nmaking it feel heavy to position.\nWARNING\nSingularity can cause injury to a person within reach of motion of the\nrobot arm, end effector and workpiece.\n• Avoid programming motions that result in any poses that can\ncause a singularity.\n\n6.3.2. Fixed and Movable Installation\nDescription\nWhether the robot arm is fixed (mounted to a stand, wall or floor) or in a movable\ninstallation (linear axis, push cart, or mobile robot base), it must be installed securely to\nensure stability through all motions.\n\n6.4.

{"text": "8. Installation\nDescription\nInstalling the robot can require the configuration and use of input and output signals\n(I/Os). These different types of I/Os and their uses are described in the following\nsections.\n8.1. Electrical Warnings and Cautions\nWarnings\nObserve the following warnings for all the interface groups, including when you design and\ninstall an application.\nWARNING\nFailure to follow any of the below can result in serious injury or death, as\nthe safety functions could be overridden.\n• Never connect safety signals to a PLC that is not a safety PLC with\nthe correct safety level. It is important to keep safety interface\nsignals separated from the normal I/O interface signals.\n• All safety-related signals shall be constructed redundantly (two\nindependent channels).\n• Keep the two independent channels separate so a single fault\ncannot lead to loss of the safety function.\nWARNING: ELECTRICITY\nFailure to follow any of the below can result in serious injury or death due to\nelectrical hazards.\n• Make sure all equipment not rated for water exposure remain dry. If water\nis allowed to enter the product, lockout-tagout all power and then contact\nyour local Universal Robots service provider for assistance.\n• Only use the original cables supplied with the robot only. Do not use the\nrobot for applications where the cables are subject to flexing.\n• Use caution when installing interface cables to the robot I/O. The metal\nplate in the bottom is intended for interface cables and connectors.\nRemove the plate before drilling holes. Make sure that all shavings are\nremoved before reinstalling the plate. Remember to use correct gland\nsizes.\n\nCAUTION\nDisturbing signals with levels higher than those defined in the specific IEC\nstandards can cause unexpected behaviors from the robot. Be aware of the\nfollowing:\n• The robot has been tested according to international IEC standards for\nElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC). Very high signal levels or\nexcessive exposure can damage the robot permanently. EMC problems\nare found to happen usually in welding processes and are normally\nprompted by error messages in the log. Universal Robots cannot be held\nresponsible for any damages caused by EMC problems.\n• I/O cables going from the Control Box to other machinery and factory\nequipment may not be longer than 30m, unless additional tests are\nperformed.\nGROUND\nNegative connections are referred to as Ground (GND) and are connected to the\ncasing of the robot and the Control Box. All mentioned GND connections are\nonly for powering and signalling. For PE (Protective Earth) use the M6-size\nscrew connections marked with earth symbols inside the Control Box. The\ngrounding conductor shall have at least the current rating of the highest current\nin the system.\nREAD MANUAL\nSome I/Os inside the Control Box can be configured for either normal or safety-\nrelated I/O.

Safety I/O\nSafety I/O\nThis section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable\nI/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.\nSafety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the\nrisk assessment in chapter Safety.\nAll safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety\nfunction. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.\nThe permanent safety input types are:\n• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only\n• Safeguard Stop for protective devices\n• 3PE Stop for protective devices\nTable\nThe functional difference is shown below.\nEmergency\nStop\nSafeguard Stop\n3PE Stop\nRobot stops moving\nYes\nYes\nYes\nProgram execution\nPauses\nPauses\nPauses\nDrive power\nOff\nOn\nOn\nReset\nManual\nAutomatic or\nmanual\nAutomatic or\nmanual\nFrequency of use\nInfrequent\nEvery cycle to\ninfrequent\nEvery cycle to\ninfrequent\nRequires re-initialization\nBrake release\nonly\nNo\nNo\nStop Category (IEC 60204-1)\n1\n2\n2\nPerformance level of monitoring\nfunction (ISO 13849-1)\nPLd\nPLd\nPLd\nSafety\ncaution\nUse the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop\nOutput.

The safety input is sampled every millisecond and\nthe state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7\nmilliseconds.\nOSSD\nSafety\nSignals\nYou can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is\ninactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs\nactive/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on\nthe safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected\nto a supply and shuts down the robot.\nThe illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length\n(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)\nTo enable OSSD for Safety Output\n1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.\n2. Under Safety, select I/O.\n3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\n3-Position\nEnabling\nDevice\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\nFreedrive on\nrobot\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\npress position.\n\nInput\nSignals\nOperational\nMode\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\nMode and Manual Mode.\nSafeguard\nReset\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\nAutomatic\nMode\nSafeguard\nStop\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\nWARNING\n• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program\npaused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.\n• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode\nSafeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard\nStop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A\nprogram paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.\n\nOutput\nSignals\nYou can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the\nstate which triggered the high signal has ended:\nSystem\nEmergency\nStop\nSignal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an\nEmergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the\nEmergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency\nStopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low\nsignal will not be given.\nRobot Moving\nSignal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.\nRobot Not\nStopping\nSignal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping\ndue to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic\nlow.\nReduced\nSignal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the\nsafety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is\ncurrently low. Otherwise the signal is high.\nNot Reduced\nThis is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.\nSafe Home\nSignal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe\nHome Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.\nNOTICE\nAny external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot\nthrough the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s\noperator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must\nrequire manual action in order to resume.\n\n8.2.2. I/O Setup\nDescription\nUse the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab\ncontrol. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.\nYou can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general\npurpose registers.\nIf you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes\nunavailable.\nNOTICE\nWhen starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can\nbegin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual\nmovement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.\nI/O Signal\nType\nTo limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu\nto change the displayed content based on signal type.\nAssigning\nUser-defined\nNames\nYou can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.\n1. Select the desired signal.\n2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.\n3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.\nYou must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in\nthe program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).\nThe Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find\nnamed general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor\nscreen.\n\nI/O Actions\nand I/O Tab\nControl\nYou can use Physical and Fieldbus digital I/Os to trigger actions or react to the status of a\nprogram.\nI/O Tab\nControl\nUse I/O Tab Control to specify whether an output is controlled on the I/O tab (by either\nprogrammers, or both operators and programmers), or if it is controlled by the robot\nprograms.\nAvailable\nInput\nActions\nCommand\nAction\nStart\nStarts or resumes the current program on a rising edge (only enabled\nin Remote Control, see Settings)\nStop\nStops the current program on a rising edge\nPause\nPauses the current program on a rising edge\nFreedrive\nWhen the input is high, the robot goes into freedrive (similar to the\nfreedrive button).\nThe input is ignored if other conditions disallow freedrive.\nWARNING\nIf the robot is stopped while using the Start input action, the robot slowly\nmoves to the first waypoint of the program before executing that program. If\nthe robot is paused while using the Start input action, the robot slowly moves\nto the position from where it was paused before resuming that program.\n\nAvailable\nOutput\nActions\nAction\nOutput\nstate\nProgram state\nLow when not running\nLow\nStopped or\npaused\nHigh when not running\nHigh\nStopped or\npaused\nHigh when running, low when stopped\nLow\nHigh\nRunning,\nStopped or\npaused\nLow on unscheduled stop\nLow\nProgram\nterminated\nunscheduled\nLow on unscheduled stop, otherwise High\nLow\nHigh\nProgram\nterminated\nunscheduled\nRunning,\nstopped or\npaused\nContinuous Pulse\nAlternates\nbetween\nhigh and\nlow\nRunning\n(pause or stop\nthe program to\nmaintain the\npulse state)\nProgram\nTermination\nCause\nAn unscheduled program termination can occur for any of the reasons listed below:\n• Robot stop\n• Fault\n• Violation\n• Runtime exception", "metadata": {"source": "008__L1__8._Installation__pp59-96__L2__02__8.2._Safety_IO__pp61-70.pdf", "n_pages": 10}}

Remote ON/OFF control\nDescription\nUse remote ON/OFF control to turn the Control Box on and off without using the Teach\nPendant. It is typically used:\n• When the Teach Pendant is inaccessible.\n• When a PLC system must have full control.\n• When several robots must be turned on or off at the same time.\nRemote\nControl\nThe remote ON/OFF control provides a auxiliary 12V supply, kept active when the Control Box\nis turned off. The ON input is intended only for short time activation and works in the same way\nas the POWER button. The OFF input can be held down as desired. Use a software feature to\nload and start programs automatically (see part Part II PolyScope Manual).\nThe electrical specifications are shown below.\nTerminals\nParameter\nMin\nTyp\nMax\nUnit\n[12V - GND]\nVoltage\n10\n12\n13\nV\n[12V - GND]\nCurrent\n-\n-\n100\nmA\n[ON / OFF]\nInactive voltage\n0\n-\n0.5\nV\n[ON / OFF]\nActive voltage\n5\n-\n12\nV\n[ON / OFF]\nInput current\n-\n1\n-\nmA\n[ON]\nActivation time\n200\n-\n600\nms\nON\nOFF\n12V\nRemote\nGND\nON\nOFF\n12V\nRemote\nGND\nThis example illustrates connecting a remote\nON button.\nThis example illustrates connecting a remote\nOFF button.\nCAUTION\nMaintaining a press and hold on the power button switches the Control Box OFF\nwithout saving.\n• Do not press and hold the ON input or the POWER button without saving.\n• Use the OFF input for remote off control to allow the Control Box to save\nopen files and shut down correctly.\n\n8.7.5. Securing Tool\nDescription\nThe tool or workpiece is mounted to the tool output flange (ISO) at the tip of the robot.\nDimensions and hole pattern of the tool flange. All measurements are in millimeters.\nTool flange\nThe tool output flange (ISO 9409-1) is where the tool is mounted at the tip of the robot. It is\nrecommended to use a radially slotted hole for the positioning pin to avoid over-constraining,\nwhile keeping precise position.\nCAUTION\nVery long M8 bolts can press against the bottom of the tool flange and short\ncircuit the robot.\n• Do not use bolts that extend beyond 10 mm to mount the tool.\nWARNING\nFailure to tighten bolts properly cause injury due to loss of the adapter flange\nand/or end effector.\n• Ensure the tool is properly and securely bolted in place.\n• Ensure the tool is constructed such that it cannot create a hazardous\nsituation by dropping a part unexpectedly.\n\n8.7.6.

Tool Digital Inputs\nDescription\nThe Startup screen contains settings for automatically loading and starting a default\nprogram, and for auto-initializing the Robot arm during power up.\nTable\nThe Digital Inputs are implemented as PNP with weak pull-down resistors. This means that a\nfloating input always reads as low.

{"text": "10.2. Safety-related Functions and Interfaces\nDescription\nUniversal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as\nsafety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect\nto other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is\nconstructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d\n(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.\nSee Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and\noutputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety\ndevices to I/O.\nWARNING\nThe use of safety configuration parameters different from those\ndetermined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that\nare not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.\n• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid\nhazards due to interruption of power.\nWARNING: ELECTRICITY\nProgrammer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from\n12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.\n• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.\nAdditional\nInformation\nNOTICE\n• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must\nfollow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.\n(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and\nInterfaces)\n• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the\napplication risk assessment\n• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if\none of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety\nlimit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.\nNOTICE\nThe end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The\nfunctioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored\n\n10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions\nDescription\nUniversal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\nSafety\nFunction\nDescription\nJoint Position\nLimit\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\nJoint Speed\nLimit\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\nSafety\nPlanes\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\nelbow.\nTool\nOrientation\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\nSpeed Limit\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\neffector positions.\nForce Limit\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\nMomentum\nLimit\nLimits maximum momentum of the robot.\nPower Limit\nLimits mechanical work performed by the robot.\nStopping\nTime Limit\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\ninitiated.1\nStopping\nDistance\nLimit\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\ninitiated.\nSafety\nFunction\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\n1Robot stop was previously known as \"Protective stop\".\n\nSafety Function\nAccuracy\nPerformance Level\nCategory\nEmergency Stop\n–\nd\n3\nSafeguard Stop\n–\nd\n3\nJoint Position Limit\n5 °\nd\n3\nJoint Speed Limit\n1.15 °/s\nd\n3\nSafety Planes\n40 mm\nd\n3\nTool Orientation\n3 °\nd\n3\nSpeed Limit\n50 mm/s\nd\n3\nForce Limit\n25 N\nd\n3\nMomentum Limit\n3 kg m/s\nd\n3\nPower Limit\n10 W\nd\n3\nStopping Time Limit\n50 ms\nd\n3\nStopping Distance Limit\n40 mm\nd\n3\nSafe Home\n1.7 °\nd\n3\nWarnings\nCAUTION\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\nsituations.\n• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\nNOTICE\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\nwhen designing an application.\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\n\nWorkspace\nFront\nTilted\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\nregarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1\njoint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm\nof the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.\nPlacing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.\n\nSafety\ninputs\nThe robot also has the following safety inputs:\nSafety Input\nDescription\nEmergency\nStop Button\nPerforms a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using\nthe System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is\ninitiated in anything connected to the output.\nRobot\nEmergency\nStop\nPerforms a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) via Control Box input, informing\nother machines using the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is\ndefined.\nSystem\nEmergency\nStop\nPerforms a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) on robot only, in all modes and\ntakes precedence over all other commands.\nSafeguard\nStop\nPerforms a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in all modes, except when using\na 3-Position Enabling Device and a mode selector - then when in Manual\nMode, the Safeguard Stop can be set to only function in Automatic Mode.\nAutomatic\nMode\nSafeguard\nStop\nPerforms a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in Automatic mode ONLY.\nAutomatic Mode Safeguard Stop can only be selected when a Three-\nPosition Enabling Device is configured and installed.\nSafeguard\nReset\nReturns from the Safeguard Stop state, when a rising edge on the\nSafeguard Reset input occurs.\nReduced\nMode\nTransitions the safety system to use the Reduced mode limits.\nThree-\nPosition\nEnabling\nDevice\nInitiates a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) when the enabling device is fully\npressed or fully released in manual mode only. Three-Position Enabling\nDevice Stop is triggered when an input goes low. It is unaffected by a\nSafeguard Reset.\nFreedrive on\nrobot\nEnables freedrive, when the robot is not in Automatic Mode.\nOperational\nMode\nSwitches between Operational modes. The robot is in Automatic mode\nwhen input is low, Manual mode when input is high.\nAutomatic\nMode\nSafeguard\nReset\nReturns from the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop state, when a rising\nedge on the Automatic Mode Safeguard Reset input occurs.\n\nSafety\noutputs\nFor interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:\nSafety\nOutput\nDescription\nSystem\nEmergency\nStop\nWhile this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low\nor the Emergency Stop button is pressed.\nRobot\nMoving\nWhile this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than\n0.1 rad/s.\nRobot Not\nStopping\nLogic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to\nan Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.\nReduced\nLogic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.\nNot Reduced\nLogic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.\nSafe Home\nLogic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.\nAll safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is\nactive when the signals are low).\n10.2.2. Safety Functions\nDescription\nThe safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an\nEmergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.\nThe reactions of the safety system are:\nTrigger\nReaction\nEmergency Stop\nStop Category 1\nSafeguard Stop\nStop Category 2\n3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)\nStop Category 2\nLimit Violation\nStop Category 0\nFault Detection\nStop Category 0\nNOTICE\nIf the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-\nset to low.\n\n10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set\nDescription\nThe safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:\n• Normal\n• Reduced\nNormal and\nReduced\nYou can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct\nconfigurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\n• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\n• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.\n\nRecovery\nWhen a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint\nposition limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.\nYou cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be\nmanually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.\nThe safety limits for Recovery are:\nSafety Function\nLimit\nJoint Speed Limit\n30 °/s\nSpeed Limit\n250 mm/s\nForce Limit\n100 N\nMomentum Limit\n10 kg m/s\nPower Limit\n80 W\nThe safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.\nWARNING\nFailure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can\nlead to hazardous situations.\n• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as\nlimits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end\neffector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.", "metadata": {"source": "010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__02__10.2._Safety-related_Functions_and_Interfaces__pp99-106.pdf", "n_pages": 8}}
{"text": "10.3. Software Safety Configuration\nDescription\nThis section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that\nhelp you set up the robot Safety Configuration.\nWARNING\nBefore you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must\nconduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and\nequipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all\nwork procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to\napply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following\nin accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.\n1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from\nchanging the safety configuration e.g. installing password\nprotection.\n2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and\ninterfaces for a specific robot application.\n3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the\nrobot arm is powered on for the first time.\n4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and\nsub-tabs.\n5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety\nconfiguration settings comply with the risk assessment.\nSee Hardware Installation Manual.\n\nAccessing\nSoftware\nSafety\nSettings\nSafety Settings are password protected and can only be configured once a password is set\nand subsequently used.\nTo access the software safety settings\n1. In your PolyScope header, tap the Installation icon.\n2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety.\n3. Observe that the Robot Limits screen displays, but settings are inaccessible.\n4.

If no safety password is applied, you are prompted to set it up.\nTo set a\nSoftware\nSafety\npassword\nYou can tap the Lock tab to lock all Safety settings again or simply navigate to a screen\noutside of the Safety menu.\n1. In your PolyScope header right corner, press the Hamburger menu and select\nSettings.\n2. On the left of the screen, in the blue menu, press Password and select Safety.\n3. In New password, type a password.\n4. Now, in Confirm new password, type the same password and press Apply.\n5. In the bottom left of the blue menu, press Exit to return to previous screen.\n\n10.3.2. Changing the Software Safety Configuration\nDescription\nChanges to the Safety Configuration settings must comply with the risk assessment\nconducted by the integrator.\nRecommended\nprocedure for the\nintegrator:\nTo change the safety configuration\n1. Verify that changes comply with the risk assessment conducted by the integrator.\n2. Adjust safety settings to the appropriate level defined by the risk assessment\nconducted by the integrator.\n3. Verify that the settings are applied.\n4. Place following text in the operators’ manuals:\nBefore working near the robot, make sure that the safety configuration is as expected.\nThis can be verified e.g. by inspecting the Safety Checksum in the top right corner of\nPolyScope for any changes. (See Safety Checksum).\n\n10.3.3. Applying a New Software Safety Configuration\nDescription\nThe robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.\nYour changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.\nThe robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually\ninspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units\nin a popup.\nYou can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your\nvisual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the\nchanges are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.\nSafety Checksum\nDescription\nThe Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.\nIt could be four or eight digits.\nA four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-\ndigit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate\nchanges to the applied safety configuration.\nThe Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because\nthe Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.\nYou must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to\nreflect your changes.\n\n\n\n10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant\nDescription\nYou can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach\nPendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the\nTeach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.\nCAUTION\nIf the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the\nEmergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the\nTeach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.\nTo safely\nremove the\nTeach\nPendant\nThe robot can be used without PolyScope as the programming interface.\nTo configure the robot without a Teach Pendant\n1. In the Header tap Installation.\n2. In the Side Menu on left tap Safety and select Hardware.\n3. Input Safety password and Unlock the screen.\n4. Deselect Teach Pendant to use robot without PolyScope interface.\n5. Press Save and restart to implement changes.\n\n10.3.5. Software Safety Modes\nDescription\nUnder normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\n• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\n• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\n• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\nWARNING\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\nwithin the limits.\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\ncounterparts.\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\nDescription\nIn the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\nor by reducing the speed.\nRobot Limits\nDescription\nRobot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two\nconfiguration options: Factory Presets and Custom.\n1Robot stop was previously known as \"Protective Stop\" for Universal Robots robots.\n\nFactory\nPresets\nFactory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The\nvalues in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to\nLeast Restricted\nNOTICE\nSlider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk\nassessment.\n\nCustom\nCustom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated\nTolerance.\nPower\nLimits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the\nenvironment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and\nnot of the environment.\nMomentum\nLimits maximum robot momentum.\nStopping\nTime\nLimits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an\nemergency stop is activated.\nStopping\nDistance\nLimits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while\nstopping.\nNOTICE\nRestricting stopping time and distance affect overall\nrobot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to\n300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited\nallowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.\nTool Speed\nLimits maximum robot tool speed.\nTool Force\nLimits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to\nprevent clamping situations.\nElbow Speed\nLimits maximum robot elbow speed.\nElbow Force\nLimits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to\nprevent clamping situations.\n\nThe tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool\npositions, (see Tool Position Restriction).\nNOTICE\nYou can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their\ndefault settings.\nJoint Limits\nDescription\nJoint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint\nrotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software\nbased axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.\n\n\n\n10.3.7. Safe Home Position\nDescription\nSafe Home is a return position defined by using the user-defined Home Position.\nSafe Home I/Os are active when the Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position and a Safe\nHome I/O is defined.\nThe Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position if the joint positions are at the specified joint\nangles or a multiple of 360 degrees thereof.\nThe Safe Home Safety Output is active when the robot is standing still at the Safe Home\nPosition.\nSyncing\nfrom Home\nTo sync from Home\n1. In the Header, tap Installation.\n2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Safe Home.\n3. Under Safe Home, tap Sync from Home.\n4. Tap Apply and in the dialog box that appears, select Apply and restart.\nSafe Home\nOutput\nThe Safe Home Position must be defined before the Safe Home Output (see I/O).\nDefining\nSafe Home\nOutput\nTo define Safe Home Output\n1.

{"text": "10.4. Software Safety Restrictions\nDescription\nNOTICE\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\nsafety plane screen and configured.\nWARNING\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\nobey this restriction.\nSaf\nety\nPla\nnes\nMod\nes\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\nDisabled\nThe safety plane is never active in this state.\nNormal\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\nReduced\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\nNormal & Reduced\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\nlimit on the position.\nTrigger Reduced\nMode\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\nit.\nShow\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\ngraphics pane.\nDelete\nDeletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo\naction. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.\nRename\nPressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.\n\nConfiguring\nsafety planes\n1. In your PolyScope header, tap Installation.\n2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Planes.\n3. On the top right of the screen, in the Planes field, tap Add plane.\n4. On the bottom right of the screen, in the Properties field, set up Name, Copy\nFeature and Restrictions.\nCopy\nFeature\nIn Copy Feature, only Undefined and Base are available. You can reset a configured safety\nplane by selecting Undefined\nIf the copied feature is modified in the Features screen, a warning icon appears to the right of\nthe Copy Feature text. This indicates that the feature is out of sync i.e. the information in the\nproperties card is not updated to reflect the modifications that may have been made to the\nFeature.\n\nCol\nor\nCod\nes\nGray\nPlane is configured but disabled (A)\nYellow & Black\nNormal Plane (B)\nBlue & Green\nTrigger Plane (C)\nBlack Arrow\nThe side of the plane the tool and/or elbow is allowed to be on (For\nNormal Planes)\nGreen Arrow\nThe side of the plane the tool and/or elbow is allowed to be on (For\nTrigger Planes)\nGray Arrow\nThe side of the plane the tool and/or elbow is allowed to be on (For\nDisabled Planes)\n\nElbow\nRestriction\nYou can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of\nyour defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.\nThe diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.\nUR3e\n0.1 m\nUR5e\n0.13 m\nUR10e / UR16e\n0.15 m\nUR20 / UR30\n0.19 m\nThe information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot\nunder the section [Elbow].\nTool Flange\nRestriction\nRestricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a\nsafety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of\nthe safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.\nThe tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.\nRemoving the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the\nrestricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.\nYou can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will\nallow extra distance for the tool to move.\nRestricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is\nused to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.\n\nAdding a\nplane feature\nexample\nDisplacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane\nnormal (Z-axis of the plane feature).\nDeselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety\nplane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.\nThe unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.\nIf no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the\ntool.\nWhen working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the\ndangerous part of the tool can't go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool\nflange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or\nAssembly.\n\nTool flange\nrestriction\nexample\nIn this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis\nwith reference to the base feature.\nThe Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.\nIf the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or\n180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.\n(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)\nIf needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in\nthe safety settings.\nWhen satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.\n\n10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction\nDescription\nThe Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.\nThe limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm\nBase. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The\nfeature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.\nNOTICE\nConfiguration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend\nyou create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as\nonce the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off\nmaking it impossible to define new features.\n\nLimit\nPrope\nrties\nThe Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:\n1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define\nthe center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around\nwhich the cone is centred.\n2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.\nDisabled Tool direction limit\nNever active\nNormal Tool direction limit\nActive only when safety system is in Normal mode\nReduced Tool direction limit\nActive only when the safety system is in Reduced mode\nNormal & Reduced Tool\ndirection limit\nActive when the safety system is in Normal mode as\nwell as when it is in Reduced mode.\nYou can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy\nfeature back to \"Undefined\".\nTool\nPrope\nrties\nBy default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be\nmodified by specifying two angles:\n• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output\nflange\n• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.\nAlternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down\nmenu.\n\n10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction\nDescription\nThe Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories\nplaced on the end of the robot arm.\n• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.\n• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.\n• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.\nThese values represent the robot tool flange.\nUnder Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back\nto 0.\nA default sphere is defined at the tool flange.\n\nUser\ndefined\ntools\nFor the user defined tools, the user can change:\n• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\n• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\ndistance and safety planes.\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\npressing the sync icon (see ).\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the\ngraphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.\n\nTool Position\nWarning\nYou must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger\ncorrectly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.\nThe warning remains on the Tool Position if:\n• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.\nTo configure the tool position\n1. In the Header tap Installation.\n2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.\n3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.\n• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.\n4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.\n5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use\nthe Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General>TCP settings if such\nis defined.\n\nTool Position\nWarning\nexample\nIn this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in\nmillimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down\nmenu if one has already been set in the ->General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped\nin the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.\nThe warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.\nTool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is\nadded.", "metadata": {"source": "010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__04__10.4._Software_Safety_Restrictions__pp121-132.pdf", "n_pages": 12}}
{"text": "10.5. The First Program\nDescription\nA program is a list of commands telling the robot what to do. For most tasks,\nprogramming is done entirely using the PolyScope software. PolyScope allows you to\nteach the robot arm how to move using a series of waypoints to set up a path for the\nrobot arm to follow.\nUse the Move tab to move the Robot Arm to a desired position, or teach the position by\npulling the Robot Arm into place while holding down the Freedrive button at the top of the\nTeach Pendant.\nYou can create a program can to send I/O signals to other machines at certain points in\nthe robot’s path, and perform commands like if…then and loop, based on variables and\nI/O signals.\n\nTo create a\nsimple\nprogram\n1.

This is\nuseful when you are testing your program.\nWhen the robot is in Manual Mode (see Operational Modes), you can allow a program to\nstart from a selected node or you can start the entire program from the beginning.\nPlay From\nSelection\nThe Play button in the Footer provides options for how to start the program.\nIn the image below, the Play button is selected and Play from Selection is displayed.\n• You can start a program only from a node in the robot Program tree. The Play from\nSelection stops if a program cannot be run from a selected node.\nThe program also stops and displays an error message if an unassigned variable in\nencountered while playing a program from selected node.\n• You can use Play from Selection in a subprogram. The program execution halts\nwhen the subprogram ends.\n• You cannot use Play from Selection with a thread because threads always start from\nthe beginning.\nTo play a\nprogram from\na selected\nnode\n1. In the Program tree, select a node.\n2. In the Footer, tap Play.\n3. Select Play from Selection to run a program from a node in the program tree.\nExample\nYou can start a stopped program again from a specific node.\n\n10.5.6. Using Basic Program Nodes\nDescription\nBasic program nodes are used to create simple robot applications. Some basic program\nnodes are also used to organize your robot program and create comments in your robot\nprogram. This can be quite useful, if it is large robot program.\n10.5.7. Basic Program Nodes: Move\nDescription\nThe Move command allows the robot to move from point A to point B.\nHow the robot moves is important to the task the robot is performing.\nWhen you add a Move to your program tree, the Move pane appears to the right of the\nscreen.\nThe Movecommand controls the robot's motion via waypoints.\nWaypoints are automatically added when you add Move commands to a program.\nRead more about Waypoints.\nYou can also use Moves to set acceleration and speed for the robot arm's movement\nbetween waypoints.\nThe robot moves using four Move commands. See the Move command types below:\nMoveJ\nThe MoveJ command creates a movement from point A to point B that is optimal for the\nrobot.\nThe movement may not be a direct line between A and B, but optimal for the start position of\nthe joints and the end position of the joints.\n\nAdd a MoveJ\ncommand\n1. In your robot program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.\n2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move\nnode.\n3. Select the move node.\n4. Select the MoveJ in the drop-down menu.\nDetail\nMoveJ makes movements that are calculated in the robot arm joint space. Joints are\ncontrolled to finish their movements at the same time. This movement type results in a\ncurved path for the tool to follow. The shared parameters that apply to this movement type\nare the maximum joint speed and joint acceleration, specified in deg/s and deg/s2,\nrespectively. If it is desired to have the robot arm move fast between waypoints,\ndisregarding the path of the tool between those waypoints, this movement type is the\npreferable choice.\nMoveL\nThe MoveL command creates a movement that is a direct line from point A and point B.\nAdd a MoveL\ncommand\n1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.\n2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move\nnode.\n3. Select the move node.\n4. Select the MoveL from the drop-down menu.\nDetail\nMoveL moves the Tool Center Point (TCP) linearly between waypoints. This means that\neach joint performs a more complicated motion to keep the tool on a straight line path. The\nshared parameters that can be set for this movement type are the desired tool speed and\ntool acceleration specified in mm/s and mm/s2, respectively, and also a feature.\nMoveP\nThe MoveP command creates a movement with a constant speed between the waypoints.\nBlend between waypoints is enabled to ensure constant speed. (See Blending).\nAdd a MoveP\ncommand\n1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.\n2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with the\nMove node.\n3. Select the move node.\n4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.\nDetail\nMoveP moves the tool linearly with constant speed with circular blends, and is intended for\nsome process operations, like gluing or dispensing. The size of the blend radius is by\ndefault a shared value between all the waypoints. A smaller value will make the path turn\nsharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. While the robot arm is moving\nthrough the waypoints with constant speed, the robot control box cannot wait for either an\nI/O operation or an operator action. Doing so might stop the robot arm’s motion, or cause a\nrobot stop.\n\nMoveCircle\nThe MoveCircle command creates a circular movement, by creating a half circle.\nYou can only add CircleMove via a MoveP command.\nAdd a\nMoveCircle\ncommand\n1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.\n2. Under Basic, tap Move.\nA waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.\n3. Select the move node.\n4.

Basic Program Nodes: Waypoints\nDescription\nWaypoints are one of the most central parts of a robot program, telling the robot arm\nwhere to go one movement at a time.\nAdd\nWaypoints\nA waypoint accompanies a Move, so adding a Move is required for the first waypoint.\nAdd a\nwaypoint to a\nrobot program\n1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.\n2. Under Basic, tap Move.\nA waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.\n\nAdd additional\nwaypoints to a\nMove or\nWaypoint\n1. In your Robot Program, select a Move node or Waypoint node.\n2. Under Basic, tap Waypoint.\nThe additional waypoint is added in the Move node. This waypoint is part of the\nMove command.\nThe additional waypoint is added under the waypoint that you selected in the robot\nprogram.\nDetail\nUsing a waypoint means applying the taught relationship between the feature and the TCP\nfrom the Move command. The relationship between the feature and the TCP, applied to the\ncurrent selected feature, achieves the desired TCP location. The robot calculates how to\nposition the arm to allow the current active TCP to reach the desired TCP position.\n10.5.9. Set Payload\nDescription\nThe Set Payload command allows you to configure the payload for the robot. Payload is\nthe combined weight of everything attached to the robot tool flange.\nWhen to use:\n• When adjusting the payload weight to prevent the robot from triggering a robot\nstop. A correctly configured payload weight ensures optimal robot movement.\nSetting the payload correctly ensures optimal motion performance and avoids\nrobot stops.\n• When setting up the payload for use in a pick and place program, using a gripper.\n\nSet Payload\nUse the Set\nPayload\ncommand\n1. In your robot program, select the place or node where you wish to add a Set\ncommand.\n2. Under Basic, tap Set Payload.\n3. Use the drop-down, under Select Payload.\na. Select one of the payloads already configured.\nb. Or, use the drop-down to configure a new payload by selecting Custom\nPayload and completing the mass and CoG fields.\nTip\nYou can also use the Set Now button to set the values on the node as the active payload.\nUse tip\nRemember to always update your payload when making any changes to the\nconfiguration of the robot program.\nExample: Set\nPayload\nIn a pick and place program, you would create a default payload in the installation. Then\nyou add a Set Payload when picking up an object. You would update the payload after\nthe gripper closes, but before starting to move.\nAdditionally, you would use the Set Payload after the object has been released.\nPayload\nTransition Time\nThis is the time it takes the robot to adjust for a given payload. At the bottom of the\nscreen, you can set the transition time between different payloads.\nYou can add a payload transition time in seconds.\nSetting a transition time larger than zero, prevents the robot from doing a small \"jump\",\nwhen the payload changes. The program continues while the adjustment is taking place.\nUsing the Payload Transition Time is recommended when\npicking up or releasing heavy objects or using a vacuum gripper.\n\n10.5.10. Payload\nDescription\nYou must set the Payload, the CoG and the inertia for the robot to perform optimally.\nYou can define multiple Payloads, and switch between them in your program. This is\nuseful in Pick and Place applications, for example, where the robot picks up and\nreleases an object.\nAdding,\nRenaming,\nModfying and\nRemoving\nPayloads\nYou can start configuring a new Payload with the following actions:\n• Tap the\nto define a new Payload with a unique name. The new payload is\navailable in the drop-down menu.\n• Tap the\nto rename a Payload.\n• Tap the\nto remove a selected Payload. You cannot remove the last Payload.\nActive\nPayload\nThe checkmark in the drop-down indicates which payload is active\n. The\nactive Payload can be changed using the\n.\nDefault\nPayload\nThe default Payload is set as the active Payload before the program starts.\n• Select the desired Payload and tap Set as default to set a Payload as the default.\nThe green icon in the drop-down menu indicates the default configured Payload\n.\nSetting the\nCenter of\nGravity\nTap the fields CX, CY and CZ to set the center of gravity. The settings apply to the selected\nPayload.\n\nPayload\nEstimation\nThis feature allows the robot to help set the correct Payload and Center of Gravity (CoG).\nUsing the\nPayload\nEstimation\nWizard\n1. In the Installation Tab, under General, select Payload.\n2. On the Payload screen, tap Measure.\n3. In the Payload Estimation Wizard tap Next.\n4. Follow the steps in the Payload Estimation Wizard to set the four positions.\nSetting the four positions requires moving the robot arm into four different positions.\nThe load of the payload is measured at each position.\n5. Once all measurements are complete, you can verify the result and tap Finish.\nNOTICE\nFollow the these guidelines for best Payload Estimation results:\n• Ensure the TCP positions are as different as possible from each\nother\n• Perform the measurements within a short timespan\n• Avoid pulling on the tool and/or attached payload before and\nduring estimation\n• Robot mounting and angle must be correctly defined in the\ninstallation\n\nSetting\nInertia\nValues\nYou can select Use custom Inertia Matrix to set inertia values.\nTap the fields: IXX, IYY, IZZ, IXY, IXZ and IYZ to set the inertia for the selected Payload.\nThe inertia is specified in a coordinate system with the origin at the Center of Gravity (CoG) of\nthe payload and the axes aligned with the tool flange axes.\nThe default inertia is calculated as the inertia of a sphere with the user specified mass, and a\nmass density of 1g/cm3\n\n10.5.11. Mounting\nDescription\nSpecifying the mounting of the Robot arm serves two purposes:\n1. Making the Robot arm appear correctly on screen.\n2. Telling the controller about the direction of gravity.\nAn advanced dynamics model gives the Robot arm smooth and precise motions, as well\nas allows the Robot arm to hold itself in Freedrive Mode. For this reason, it is important\nto mount the Robot arm correctly.\nWARNING\nFailure to mount the Robot’s arm correctly may result in frequent robot\nstops, and/or the Robot arm will move when pressing the Freedrive\nbutton.\nIf the Robot arm is mounted on a flat table or floor, no change is needed on this screen.\nHowever, if the Robot arm is ceiling mounted, wall mounted, or mounted at an angle,\nthis needs to be adjusted using the buttons.\nThe buttons on the right side of the screen are for setting the angle of the Robot arm’s\nmounting. The top three right side buttons set the angle to ceiling (180∘), wall (90∘), floor\n(0∘). The Tilt buttons set an arbitrary angle.", "metadata": {"source": "010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__05__10.5._The_First_Program__pp133-162_part02_part01.pdf", "n_pages": 7}}

Using the I/O Tab\nDescription\nUse the I/O Tab screen to monitor and set the live I/O signals from/to the Control Box.\nThe screen displays the current state of the I/O, including during program execution. The\nprogram stops if anything is changed during execution. At program stop, all output\nsignals retain their states. The screen updates at 10Hz, so a very fast signal might not\ndisplay properly.\nConfigurable I/Os can be reserved for special safety settings defined in the safety I/O\nconfiguration section of the installation (see I/O); those which are reserved will have the\nname of the safety function in place of the default or user defined name.\nConfigurable outputs that are reserved for safety settings are not togglable and will be\ndisplayed as LED’s only.\nVoltage\nWhen the Tool Output is controlled by the user, you can configure Voltage. Selecting a\nURCap removes access to Voltage.\nAnalog\nDomain\nSettings\nThe analog I/O’s can be set to either current [4-20mA] or voltage [0-10V] output. These\nsettings are persistent over restarts of the robot controller and saved in the installation.\nControl over the tool I/Os could be assigned to a URCap in Tool I/O of the Installation tab.\nSelecting a URCap removes user’s control over tool’s analog I/O.\n\nTool\nCommunication\nInterface\nWhen the Tool Communication Interface TCI is enabled, the tool analog input\nbecomes unavailable. On the I/O screen, the Tool Input field appears as shown.\nDual Pin power\nWhen Dual Pin Power is enabled, the tool digital outputs must be named as follows:\n• tool_out[0] (Power)\n• tool_out[1] (GND)\n10.5.13. Analog Input: Communication Interface\nDescription\nThe Tool Communication Interface (TCI) enables the robot to communicate with an\nattached tool via the robot tool analog input. This removes the need for external cabling.\nOnce the Tool Communication Interface is enabled, all tool analog inputs are\nunavailable\nTool\nCommunication\nInterface\n1. Tap the Installation tab and under General tap Tool I/O.\n2. Select Communication Interface to edit TCI settings.\nOnce the TCI is enabled, the tool analog input is unavailable for the I/O Setup of\nthe Installation and does not appear in the input list. Tool analog input is also\nunavailable for programs as Wait For options and expressions.\n3. In the drop-down menus under Communication Interface, select required values.\nAny changes in values are immediately sent to the tool. If any installation values\ndiffer from what the tool is using, a warning appears.\n10.5.14. Digital Output\n\nDescription\nThe tool communication interface allows two digital outputs to be independently\nconfigured. In PolyScope, each pin has a drop-down menu that allows the output mode\nto be set. The following options are available:\n• Sinking: This allows the pin to be configured in an NPN or Sinking configuration.\nWhen the output is off, the pin allows a current to flow to the ground. This can be\nused in conjunction with the PWR pin to create a full circuit.\n• Sourcing: This allows the pin to be configured in a PNP or Sourcing configuration.\nWhen the output is on, the pin provides a positive voltage source (configurable in\nthe IO Tab). This can be used in conjunction with the GND pin to create a full\ncircuit.\n• Push / Pull: This allows the pin to be configured in a Push / Pull configuration.\nWhen the output is on, the pin provides a positive voltage source (configurable in\nIO Tab). This can be used in conjunction with the GND pin to create a full circuit\nWhen the output is off, the pin allows a current to flow to the ground.\nAfter selecting a new output configuration, the changes take effect. The currently loaded\ninstallation is modified to reflect the new configuration. After verifying the tool outputs are\nworking as intended, make sure to save the installation to prevent losing changes.\nDual Pin\nPower\nDual Pin Power is used as a source of power for the tool. Enabling Dual Pin Power disables\ndefault tool digital outputs.\n10.5.15. Using the Move Tab\nDescription\nUse the Move Tab screen to move (jog) the robot arm directly, either by\ntranslating/rotating the robot tool, or by moving robot joints individually.\n\nTo use the\nMove Tool\narrows\nHold down any of the Move Tool arrows to move the robot arm in the corresponding direction.\n• The Translate arrows (upper) move the tool flange in the direction indicated.\n• The Rotate arrows (lower) change the orientation of the tool in the indicated direction.\nThe rotation point is the Tool Center Point (TCP), i.e.the point at the end of the robot\narm that gives a characteristic point on the tool. The TCP is shown as a small blue ball.\nRobot\nIf the current position of the TCP approaches a safety plane, a trigger plane, or the orientation\nof robot tool is near the tool orientation boundary limit , a 3D representation of the proximate\nboundary limit is shown. The visualization of boundary limits is disabled during program\nexecution.\nSafety planes display in yellow and black with an arrow indicating which side of the plane, the\nrobot TCP is allowed to be positioned.\nTrigger planes display in blue and green with an arrow indicating the side of the plane, where\nthe Normal mode limits are active.\nThe tool orientation boundary limit is visualized with a spherical cone together with a vector\nindicating the current orientation of the robot tool. The inside of the cone represents the\nallowed area for the tool orientation (vector).\nWhen the robot TCP is no longer in proximity of the limit, the 3D representation disappears. If\nthe TCP is in violation or very close to violating a boundary limit, the visualization of the limit\nturns red.\nFeature\nUnder Feature, you can define how to control the robot arm relative to View, Base or Tool\nfeatures. For the best feel for controlling the robot arm you can select the View feature, then\nuse Rotate arrows to change the viewing angle of the 3D image to match your view of the\nreal robot arm.\nActive TCP\nIn the Robot field, under Active TCP, the name of the current active Tool Center Point (TCP)\nis displayed.\nHome\nThe Home button accesses the Move Robot into Position screen, where you can hold down\nthe Auto button to move robot into position previously defined under Installation.

The shadow shows the Robot Arm\ntarget position controlled by the specified values on the screen. Press the magnifying glass\nicons to zoom in/out or drag a finger across it to change the view.\nIf the specified target position of the robot TCP is close to a safety or trigger plane, or the\norientation of robot tool is near the tool orientation boundary limit, a 3D representation of the\nproximate boundary limit is shown. Safety planes are visualized in yellow and black with a\nsmall arrow representing the plane normal, which indicates the side of the plane on which the\nrobot TCP is allowed to be positioned. Trigger planes are displayed in blue and green and a\nsmall arrow pointing to the side of the plane, where the Normal mode limits are active. The\ntool orientation boundary limit is visualized with a spherical cone together with a vector\nindicating the current orientation of the robot tool. The inside of the cone represents the\nallowed area for the tool orientation (vector). When the target robot TCP is no longer in\nproximity of the limit, the 3D representation disappears. If the target TCP is in violation or very\nclose to violating a boundary limit, the visualization of the limit turns red.\n\nFeature and\nTool\nPosition\nThe active TCP and coordinate values of the selected feature are displayed. The X, Y, Z\ncoordinates specify tool position. The RX, RY, RZ coordinates specify orientation.\nUse the drop down menu above the RX, RY and RZ boxes to choose the orientation\nrepresentation type:\n• Rotation Vector [rad] The orientation is given as a rotation vector. The length of the\naxis is the angle to be rotated in radians, and the vector itself gives the axis about\nwhich to rotate. This is the default setting.\n• Rotation Vector [∘] The orientation is given as a rotation vector, where the length of\nthe vector is the angle to be rotated in degrees.\n• RPY [rad]Roll, pitch and yaw (RPY) angles, where the angles are in radians. The\nRPY-rotation matrix (X, Y’, Z” rotation) is given by:\nRrpy(γ, β, α) = RZ(α) ⋅RY(β) ⋅RX(γ)\n• RPY [∘]Roll, pitch and yaw (RPY) angles, where angles are in degrees.\nYou can tap the values to edit the coordinates. You can also tap the + or - buttons to the right\nof a box to add/subtract an amount to/from the current value. Or you can hold down a button\nto directly increase/decrease the value.\nJoint\nPositions\nIndividual joint positions are specified directly.

General Cybersecurity\nDescription\nConnecting a Universal Robots robot to a network can introduce cybersecurity risks.\nThese risks can be mitigated by using qualified personnel and implementing specific\nmeasures for protecting the robot's cybersecurity.\nImplementing cybersecurity measures requires conducting a cybersecurity threat\nassessment.\nThe purpose is to:\n• Identify threats\n• Define trust zones and conduits\n• Specify the requirements of each component in the application\nWARNING\nFailure to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment can place the robot\nat risk.\n• The integrator or competent, qualified personnel shall conduct a\ncybersecurity risk assessment.\nNOTICE\nOnly competent, qualified personnel shall be responsible for\ndetermining the need for specific cybersecurity measures and for\nproviding the required cybersecurity measures.\n11.2. Cybersecurity Requirements\nDescription\nConfiguring your network and securing your robot requires you to implement the threat\nmeasures for cybersecurity.\nFollow all the requirements before you start configure your network, then verify the robot\nsetup is secure.\n\nCybersecurity\n• Operating personnel must have a thorough understanding of general\ncybersecurity principles and advanced technologies as used in the UR robot.\n• Physical security measures must be implemented to allow only authorized\npersonnel physical access to the robot.\n• There must be adequate control of all access points. For example: locks on\ndoors, badge systems, physical access control in general.\nWARNING\nConnecting the robot to a network that is not properly secured, can\nintroduce security and safety risks.\n• Only connect your robot to a trusted and properly secured\nnetwork.\nNetwork\nconfiguration\nrequirements\n• Only trusted devices are to be connected to the local network.\n• There must be no inbound connections from adjacent networks to the robot.\n• Outgoing connections from the robot are to be restricted to allow the smallest\nrelevant set of specific ports, protocols and addresses.\n• Only URCaps and magic scripts from trusted partners can be used, and only\nafter verifying their authenticity and integrity\nRobot setup\nsecurity\nrequirements\n• Change the default password to a new, strong password.\n• Disable the \"Magic Files\" when not actively used (PolyScope 5).\n• Disable SSH access when not needed. Prefer key-based authentication over\npassword-based authentication\n• Set the robot firewall to the most restrictive usable settings and disable all\nunused interfaces and services, close ports and restrict IP addresses\n\n11.3. Cybersecurity Hardening Guidelines\nDescription\nAlthough PolyScope includes many features for keeping the network connection secure,\nyou can harden security by observing to following guidelines:\n• Before connecting your robot to any network, always change the default password\nto a strong password.\nNOTICE\nYou cannot retrieve or reset a forgotten or lost password.\n• Store all passwords securely.\n• Use the built-in settings to restrict the network access to the robot as much as\npossible.\n• Some communication interfaces have no method of authenticating and encrypting\ncommunication. This is a security risk. Consider appropriate mitigating measures,\nbased on your cybersecurity threat assessment.\n• SSH tunneling (Local port forwarding) must be used to access robot interfaces\nfrom other devices if the connection crosses the trust zone boundary.\n• Remove sensitive data from the robot before it is decommissioned. Pay particular\nattention to the URCaps and data in the program folder.\n• To ensure secure removal of highly sensitive data, securely wipe or destroy\nthe SD card.\nFor information about setting an admin password and local port forwarding, see the\nHamburger Menu.\nYou can also read Secure Setup on www.universal-robots.com/articles\n\n11.4.

{"text": "13. Emergency Events\nDescription\nFollow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the\nemergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually\nmove the system without power.\n13.1. Emergency Stop\nDescription\nThe Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\ncomply with ISO 13850.\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\nthat initiated the stop.\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\nbutton.\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\nreset.\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\n3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume\noperation.\n\n13.2. Movement Without Drive Power\nDescription\nIn the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\ntorque.\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\nrobot arm.\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\nWARNING\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\ninjury or death.\n• Support the robot arm before removing power.\nNOTICE\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\nproperty damage.\n• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\nrobot can find its original physical position.\n• Do not move any joint more than necessary.\n\n13.3. Modes\nDescription\nYou access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard\nServer. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or\nthe Dashboard Server.\nAutomatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined\ntasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\nprograms and installations.\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.\nMode\nswitching\nOperational mode\nManual\nAutomatic\nFreedrive\nx\n*\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab\nx\n*\nEdit & save program & installation\nx\nExecute Programs\nReduced\nspeed**\n*\nStart program from selected node\nx\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\n\nNotice when\nswitching\nmode\nNOTICE\n• Some UR robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\nEnabling Device. If the risk assessment requires the enabling\ndevice, a 3PE Teach Pendant must be used.\nWARNING\n• Any suspended safeguards must be returned to full functionality\nbefore selecting Automatic Mode.\n• Wherever possible, Manual Mode shall only be used with all\npersons located outside the safeguarded space.\n• If an external mode selector is used, it must be placed outside the\nsafeguarded space.\n• No-one is to enter, or be within, the safeguarded space in Automatic\nMode, unless safeguarding is used or the collaborative application\nis validated for power and force limiting (PFL).\nTo Switch\nModes: PolyScope\n1. In the Header, select the profile icon.\n• Automatic indicates the operational mode of the robot is set to\nAutomatic.\n• Manual indicates the operational mode of the robot is set to Manual.\nUsing the\nDashboard\nServer\n1. Connect to the Dashboard server.\n2. Use the Set Operational Mode commands.\n• Set Operational Mode Automatic\n• Set Operational Mode Manual\n• Clear Operational Mode\nThree-Position\nEnabling\nDevice\nWhen a Three-Position Enabling Device is used and the robot is in Manual Mode,\nmovement requires pressing the Three-Position Enabling Device to the center-on\nposition. The Three-Position Enabling Device has no effect in Automatic Mode.\nA 3PE Teach Pendant is recommended for programming. If another person can be within\nthe safeguarded space when in Manual Mode, an additional device can be integrated and\nconfigured for the additional person's use.\n\n13.3.1. Recovery Mode\nDescription\nWhen a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the\nrobot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .\nYou cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.\nDuring Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either\nFreedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.\nSafety limits\nof Recovery\nMode\nSafety Function\nLimit\nJoint Speed Limit\n30 °/s\nSpeed Limit\n250 mm/s\nForce Limit\n100 N\nMomentum Limit\n10 kg m/s\nPower Limit\n80 W\nThe safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.\nWARNING\nFailure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can\nlead to hazardous situations.\n• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as\nlimits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end\neffector orientation are all disabled in recovery.\n13.3.2. Backdrive\nDescription\nBackdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without\nreleasing all brakes in the robot arm.\nThis is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that\naccompany a full restart are not desired.\nThe robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.\nYou can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:\n• 3PE Teach Pendant\n• 3PE device/switch\n• Freedrive on robot\n\n3PE Teach\nPendant\nTo use the 3PE TP button to backdrive the robot arm.\n1.

Table 2\nDescription\nUR e-Series robots comply with ISO 10218-1:2011 and the applicable portions of\nISO/TS 15066. It is important to note that most of ISO/TS 15066 is directed towards the\nintegrator and not the robot manufacturer. ISO 10218-1:2011, clause 5.10 collaborative\noperation details 4 collaborative operation techniques as explained below. It is very\nimportant to understand that collaborative operation is of the APPLICATION when in\nAUTOMATIC mode.\nCollaborative\nOperation 2011\nedition, clause\n5.10.2\nTechnique\nExplanation\nUR e-Series\nSafety-rated\nmonitored\nstop\nStop condition where position is held at a\nstandstill and is monitored as a safety\nfunction. Category 2 stop is permitted to\nauto reset. In the case of resetting and\nrestarting operation after a safety -rated\nmonitored stop, see ISO 10218-2 and\nISO/TS 15066 as resumption shall not\ncause hazardous conditions.\nUR robots’ safeguard\nstop is a safety-rated\nmonitored stop, See SF2\non page 1. It is likely, in\nthe future, that “safety-\nrated monitored stop” will\nnot be called a form of\ncollaborative operation.\n\nCollaborative\nOperation 2011\nedition, clause\n5.10.3\nTechnique\nExplanation\nUR e-Series\nHand-\nguiding\nThis is essentially individual\nand direct personal control\nwhile the robot is in automatic\nmode. Hand guiding\nequipment shall be located\nclose to the end-effector and\nshall have:\n• an Emergency Stop\npushbutton\n• a 3-position enabling\ndevice\n• a safety-rated\nmonitored stop\nfunction\n• a settable safety-rated\nmonitored speed\nfunction\nUR robots do not provide hand-guiding\nfor collaborative operation. Hand-\nguided teach (free drive) is provided\nwith UR robots but this is for\nprogramming in manual mode and not\nfor collaborative operation in automatic\nmode.\n\nCollaborative\nOperation 2011\nedition, clause\n5.10.4\nTechnique\nExplanation\nUR e-Series\nSpeed and\nseparation\nmonitoring\n(SSM) safety\nfunctions\nSSM is the robot\nmaintaining a separation\ndistance from any\noperator (human). This is\ndone by monitoring of the\ndistance between the\nrobot system and\nintrusions to ensure that\nthe MINIMUM\nPROTECTIVE\nDISTANCE is assured.\nUsually, this is\naccomplished using\nSensitive Protective\nEquipment (SPE), where\ntypically a safety laser\nscanner detects intrusion\n(s) towards the robot\nsystem.\nThis SPE causes:\n1. dynamic changing\nof the parameters\nfor the limiting\nsafety functions; or\n2. a safety-rated\nmonitored stop\ncondition.\nUpon detection of the\nintrusion exiting the\nprotective device’s\ndetection zone, the robot\nis permitted to:\n1. resume the\n“higher” normal\nsafety function\nlimits in the case of\n1) above\n2. resume operation\nin the case of 2)\nabove\nIn the case of 2) 2),\nrestarting operation after\na safety -rated monitored\nstop, see ISO 10218-2\nand ISO/TS 15066 for\nrequirements.\nTo facilitate SSM, UR robots have the\ncapability of switching between two sets of\nparameters for safety functions with\nconfigurable limits (normal and reduced).\nSee Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal\noperation can be when no intrusion is\ndetected. It can also be caused by safety\nplanes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety\nzones can be readily used with UR robots.\nFor example, one safety zone can be used\nfor “reduced settings” and another zone\nboundary is used as a safeguard stop input\nto the UR robot. Reduced limits can also\ninclude a reduced setting for the stop time\nand stop distance limits – to reduce the\nwork area and floorspace.\n\nCollaborative\nOperation 2011\nedition, clause\n5.10.5\nTechnique\nExplanation\nUR e-Series\nPower and\nforce limiting\n(PFL) by\ninherent\ndesign or\ncontrol\nHow to accomplish PFL is left to the\nrobot manufacturer. The robot\ndesign and/or safety functions will\nlimit the energy transfer from the\nrobot to a person. If any parameter\nlimit is exceeded, a robot stop\nhappens. PFL applications require\nconsidering the ROBOT\nAPPLICATION (including the end-\neffector and workpiece(s), so that\nany contact will not cause injury. The\nstudy performed evaluated\npressures to the ONSET of pain, not\ninjury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR\n20218-1 End-effectors.\nUR robots are power and force\nlimiting robots specifically\ndesigned to enable\ncollaborative applications where\nthe robot could contact a person\nand cause no injury. UR robots\nhave safety functions that can\nbe used to limit motion, speed,\nmomentum, force, power and\nmore of the robot. These safety\nfunctions are used in the robot\napplication to thereby lessen\npressures and forces caused by\nthe end-effector and workpiece\n(s).", "metadata": {"source": "019__L1__19._Safety_Functions_Table__pp211-222__L2__02__19.2._Table_2__pp219-222.pdf", "n_pages": 4}}
