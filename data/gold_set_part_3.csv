Why does my robot arm look to be vibrating when running?,This could be due to the dimensionsing of the stand used. If the resonance frequency of the stand is lower than 45Hz it can resonate with the movement of the arm and make it look like the entire  system is vibrating.
How can I reduce the force applied to the operator in case of a collision?,"To reduce the force applied to the operator in a collision you can change the force and power limiting safety setting. They are used to reduce clamping and pressures exerted by the robot in case of collisions. 
The momentum limiting option can also be used to reduce high transient energy and impact forces in case of collisions by reducing the speed of the robot. There is also a speed limitation, which is used to ensure the speed of the robot is within limits set."
Do I need to worry about a strong electromagnet near my robot?,"Yes, operating the arm near strong magnetic fields can damage the robot."
Why do I need to set the center of gravity for the payload?,"Failure to configure the center of gravity correctly can result in certain procedures failing, such as freedrive. If the center of gravity is not set up correctly it could result in the arm falling on its own."
What happens if I offset the center of gravity?,"The offset for the center of gravity can affect the way the arm moves due to what it expects the object's center to be.
The greater the center of gravity is offset from the origin, the more the capacity of the arm to accelerate can be reduced. 
Too great of a center of gravity, or too much weight can result in tipping hazards."
Why do I need to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment?,"To identify threats, define trust zones and conduits, and specify the requirements of each component in the application."
Who should do the cybersecurity risk assessment?,Either the integrator(could be user) or a competent qualified personnel. 
Are there risks associated with using 12V vs 24V?,"Using one or the other is fine so long as the setting matches. Using one, and marking to robot to use the other can be a risk."
"My robot arm stopped moving and then had a strong, sudden movement. What could have caused this? How can I prevent this from happening again?","This is likely a ""singularity."" A singularity is a pose that restricts the motion and ability to position the robot. If the arm is approaching a singularity it can stop moving or have very sudden and fast movements. This is likely an artifact of the program that is running. To prevent a singularity from occurring, avoid programming motions that result in any poses that could cause a singularity. "
Can you describe the robot stop categories?,"There are three kinds of stop categories.
Stop Category 0: Immediately stops the arm by removing the power.
Stop Category 1: Stops the robot in a controlled manner, and removes the power once it is fully stopped.
Stop Category 2: Stops the robot with power available to the drives, while maintaining the current trajectory. Power is maintained after the robot is stopped."
"I plugged in an active adapter, but nothing is showing up. What should I do?","You must ensure that the adapter is fully plugged in, and plugged in before powering on the control box. Adapters that do not support revision 1.2 are not garunteed to work. Please check that the adapter adheres to these requirements."
Can I connect or disconnect my teach pendant while the control box is on?,No. Connecting or disconnecting the teach pendant should be done when the control box is powered off. Connecting or disconnecting while the control box is on can cause damage to the control box.
What are the two yellow buttons on the back side of my teach pendant?,Those are the 3PE buttons. 
What is the function of the 3PE buttons?,"When the 3PE button is not pressed, the robot movement is stopped, power is not removed from the robot arm, and the brakes are release. When there is light pressure the current program can play while the mode is set to manual. When there is tight pressure the robot movement is stopped in manual mode, and the robot is in 3PE stop mode. If you light press it twice and hold the button down,  you can enter fredrive mode and manually move the arm to a desired position while the buttons light pressure is held down. "
What happens if the robot detects a mismatch between mounting configuration and sensor data during first boot?,If a mismatch is found between the mounting and the sensor data with a tolerance of 30 degrees the start button is disabled and an error message is displayed below it.
