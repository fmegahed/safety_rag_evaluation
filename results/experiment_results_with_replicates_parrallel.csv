- “Reduced — activated by a Trigger Reduced plane or a configured safety input; uses more restrictive limits.” The manual states Reduced mode is activated when the TCP is beyond a Trigger Reduced plane or via a configurable input, and reduced limits (e.g., speed and momentum) must be more restrictive than Normal. This matches the student’s statement.
- “Recovery — activated when a safety limit is violated or a limit is exceeded at …” The phrasing is truncated, but the intended meaning aligns with the facts: Recovery mode activates when a safety limit is violated, and if a limit is already violated at power-on, the robot starts in Recovery.

  - Definition of Stopping Time Limit: “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”

Introducing “1000 ms” without referencing the configuration or an example from the FACTS constitutes information outside the given scope.
- Because the statement is unfinished, it neither correctly explains how Stopping Time Limit works (e.g., dynamic speed reduction to stay within limits, Stop Category 0 on violations) nor ties to any specific safety behavior (Emergency Stop/Safeguard Stop categories) described in the FACTS.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The provided facts include a “Commissioning” section that explicitly states tests to perform “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” This directly answers the question.
- Those tests include: verifying all safety inputs/outputs, testing all safety devices (including those shared across machines), testing emergency stop buttons/inputs, testing safeguard inputs and reset, checking reduced mode activation and mode icon changes, verifying the 3-position enabling device in manual mode, verifying Emergency Stop outputs (if used), and checking status outputs like Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode.
- Additional facts reinforce post-modification checks: the Maintenance and Repair section says to perform checks after maintenance/repair to ensure required safety level and to test all safety functions; “Testing Stopping Performance” covers periodic verification of stop times/distances; the Inspection Plan provides specific physical checks (cables, mounting bolts, flat rings, tool flange, etc.); Backdrive inspection and safety configuration/password/Checksum guidance are also relevant safeguards to verify after changes.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s key claims:
- They state that commissioning tests must be performed after any modification.
- They list specific commissioning checks: verifying safety I/O connections, testing all connected safety inputs/outputs (including devices common to multiple machines/robots), and testing emergency stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage.

2) Compare with the provided FACTS:
- The Commissioning section explicitly says tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” This matches the student’s first claim.
- The listed checks in the FACTS include:
  • “Verify all safety inputs and outputs are correctly connected.”
  • “Test all connected safety input and output, including devices common to multiple machines or robots, are functioning as intended.”
  • “Test emergency stop buttons and inputs to verify the robot stops and the brakes engage.”
These align exactly with the student’s bullet points.

3) Check for hallucinations:
- The student does not introduce requirements or details not present in the FACTS. Their wording mirrors the manual content. No extraneous standards, procedures, or specifications are added beyond what’s given.

4) Note on completeness:
- While the student’s list is partial (the manual includes additional commissioning checks), the grading criteria focus on groundedness and avoiding hallucinations, not completeness. The included items are accurate and sourced from the FACTS.

Conclusion:
Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after modifying a robot arm.
- The student directly answers “Yes” and instructs to perform commissioning tests per the manual, which is an appropriate and general post-modification action.
- The student provides a concise list of key checks (safety I/O verification, testing safety devices, emergency stop behavior). These are relevant and actionable.
- The answer is concise and focused on the question. While the last bullet appears truncated and additional checks (e.g., calibration/payload verification) could add value, the response still clearly helps the user know what to do.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth specifies that after a modification, a series of commissioning/safety tests must be performed, listing specific checks (safety I/O connections, testing all safety I/O including shared devices, emergency stop behavior including brake engagement, safeguard inputs and resets, reduced mode indication, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device behavior, emergency stop outputs affecting the whole system, testing robot status outputs, and determining commissioning requirements).
- The student answer correctly states that commissioning tests must be performed and lists several key checks that match the ground truth: verifying safety I/O connections, testing all safety I/O including devices common to multiple machines/robots, and testing emergency stop behavior with brake engagement.
- There are no conflicting statements in the student answer.
- Although the student’s list is incomplete compared to the full ground truth, the grading criterion focuses on factual accuracy, not completeness.

- The provided facts explicitly include a “Commissioning” section that states: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and then lists concrete checks (verify safety I/O wiring, test all safety inputs/outputs, test E-stop and safeguard stop, verify reduced mode indication, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, emergency stop outputs behavior, and safety-related outputs).
- Additional sections reinforce post-maintenance checks: “Safety for Maintenance” requires verifying the required safety level and testing all safety functions after maintenance/repair; “Testing Stopping Performance” discusses verifying stopping performance; “Robot Arm Inspection Plan” details inspection steps (cables, bolts, flat rings, freedrive hold); “Software Safety Configuration” and “Safety Checksum” cover applying and verifying safety configuration changes.
- Other content (e.g., waypoints, payload setup, I/O configuration) is less directly tied to post-modification checks, but the presence of multiple directly relevant sections satisfies the relevance criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The student asserts that commissioning tests must be performed before first use and after any modification. This matches the FACTS: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.”
- The student lists specific checks:
  - Verify all safety inputs/outputs are correctly connected and test each, including devices common to multiple machines/robots. This is explicitly in the FACTS.
  - Test emergency stop buttons/inputs to confirm the robot stops and brakes engage; test safeguard inputs and, if configured, the safeguard reset. This aligns exactly with the FACTS.
  - Verify UI/state indications: look at the initialization screen, activate the reduced input and verify the screen changes; change operational mode and confirm the mode icon changes; test the 3‑position enabling device enabling motion in manual at reduced speed. All of these are directly from the FACTS.
- The student does not introduce any procedures or terms that are absent from the FACTS; no conflicting claims are made.
- Minor omissions compared to the full commissioning list are present (e.g., testing Emergency Stop outputs if used to verify whole-system stop, testing systems connected to Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode/Not Reduced Mode outputs, and “determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application”), but omissions do not constitute hallucinations or lack of grounding.

Conclusion:
