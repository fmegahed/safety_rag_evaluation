Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

12.2. MODBUS

Description Here, the MODBUS client (master) signals can be set up. Connections to MODBUS
servers (or slaves) on specified IP addresses can be created with input/output signals
(registers or digital). Each signal has a unique name so it can be used in programs.

Refresh Push this button to refresh all MODBUS connections. Refreshing disconnects all modbus
units, and connects them back again. All statistics are cleared.

Add unit Push this button to add a new MODBUS unit.

Delete unit Push this button to delete the MODBUS unit and all signals on that unit.

Set unit IP Here the IP address of the MODBUS unit is shown. Press the button to change it.

Sequential
mode

Available only when Show Advanced Options selected. Selecting this checkbox forces the
modbus client to wait for a response before sending the next request. This mode is
required by some fieldbus units. Turning this option on may help when there are multiple
signals, and increasing request frequency results in signal disconnects.
The actual signal frequency may be lower than requested when multiple signals are
defined in sequential mode. Actual signal frequency can be observed in signal statistics.
The signal indicator turns yellow if the actual signal frequency is less than half of the value
selected from the Frequency drop-down list.

Add signal Push this button to add a signal to the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Delete
signal

Push this button to delete a MODBUS signal from the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Set
sig
nal
type

Use this drop down menu to choose the signal type.
Available types are:

Digital input
A digital input (coil) is a one-bit quantity which is read from the
MODBUS unit on the coil specified in the address field of the signal.
Function code 0x02 (Read Discrete Inputs) is used.

Digital output

A digital output (coil) is a one-bit quantity which can be set to either
high or low. Before the value of this output has been set by the user,
the value is read from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that
function code 0x01 (Read Coils) is used. When the output has been
set by a robot program or by pressing the set signal value button,
the function code 0x05 (Write Single Coil) is used onwards.

Register input

A register input is a 16-bit quantity read from the address specified
in the address field. The function code 0x04 (Read Input Registers)
is used.

Register output

A register output is a 16-bit quantity which can be set by the user.
Before the value of the register has been set, the value of it is read
from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that function code 0x03
(Read Holding Registers) is used. When the output has been set by
a robot program or by specifying a signal value in the set signal
value field, function code 0x06 (Write Single Register) is used to set
the value on the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
address

This field shows the address on the remote MODBUS server. Use the on-screen keypad to
choose a different address. Valid addresses depends on the manufacturer and configuration
of the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
name

Using the on-screen keyboard, the user can give the signal a name. This name is used when
the signal is used in programs.

Signal
value

Here, the current value of the signal is shown. For register signals, the value is expressed as
an unsigned integer. For output signals, the desired signal value can be set using the button.
Again, for a register output, the value to write to the unit must be supplied as an unsigned
integer.

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

15.1. Testing Stopping Performance

Description Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded. Increased stopping
times can require safeguarding to be modified, possibly with changes to the installation.
If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used and are the basis of the risk
reduction strategy, no monitoring or testing of stopping performance is required. The
robot does continuous monitoring.

15.2. Robot ArmCleaning and Inspection

Description As part of regular maintenance the robot arm can be cleaned, in accordance with the
recommendations in this manual and local requirements.

Cleaning
Methods

To address the dust, dirt, or oil on the robot arm and/or Teach Pendant, simply use a cloth
alongside one of the cleaning agents provided below.

Surface Preparation: Before applying the below solutions, surfaces may need to be
prepared by removing any loose dirt or debris.

Cleaning agents:

• Water

• 70% Isopropyl alcohol

• 10% Ethanol alcohol

• 10% Naphtha (Use to remove grease.)

Application: The solution is typically applied to the surface that needs cleaning using a
spray bottle, brush, sponge, or cloth. It can be applied directly or diluted further depending
on the level of contamination and the type of surface being cleaned.
Agitation: For stubborn stains or heavily soiled areas, the solution may be agitated using
a brush, scrubber, or other mechanical means to help loosen the contaminants.
Dwell Time: If necessary, the solution is allowed to dwell on the surface for a up to 5
minutes to penetrate and dissolve the contaminants effectively.
Rinsing: After the dwell time, the surface is typically rinsed thoroughly with water to
remove the dissolved contaminants and any remaining cleaning agent residue. It&#x27;s
essential to ensure thorough rinsing to prevent any residue from causing damage or
posing a safety hazard.
Drying: Finally, the cleaned surface may be left to air dry or dried using towels.

WARNING

DO NOT USE BLEACH in any diluted cleaning solution.

Software Safety Configuration

Description This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.

WARNING

Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.

1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.

2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.

3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.

4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.

5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.
See Hardware Installation Manual.

10.3.3. Applying aNewSoftware Safety Configuration

Description The robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.
Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.

Safety Checksum

Description The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.

It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

Table The functional difference is shown below.

Use the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop
Output. Configuring a set of configurable I/O for safety functions are done through the GUI,
(see part Part II PolyScope Manual).

CAUTION

Failure to verify and test the safety functions regularly can lead to
hazardous situations.

• Safety functions shall be verified before putting the robot into
operation.

• Safety functions shall be tested regularly.

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

3-position enabling device.
When in teach/program, initially both TCP speed and elbow speed will
be limited to 250mm/s. The speed can manually be increased by using
the pendant user interface “speed-slider”, but upon activation of the

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Safety-rated
monitored
stop

Stop condition where position is held at a

auto reset. In the case of resetting and
restarting operation after a safety -rated
monitored stop, see ISO 10218-2 and
ISO/TS 15066 as resumption shall not
cause hazardous conditions.

UR robots’ safeguard
stop is a safety-rated

Collaborative
Operation 2011
edition, clause
5.10.4

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

12.2. MODBUS

Description Here, the MODBUS client (master) signals can be set up. Connections to MODBUS
servers (or slaves) on specified IP addresses can be created with input/output signals
(registers or digital). Each signal has a unique name so it can be used in programs.

Refresh Push this button to refresh all MODBUS connections. Refreshing disconnects all modbus
units, and connects them back again. All statistics are cleared.

Add unit Push this button to add a new MODBUS unit.

Delete unit Push this button to delete the MODBUS unit and all signals on that unit.

Set unit IP Here the IP address of the MODBUS unit is shown. Press the button to change it.

Sequential
mode

Available only when Show Advanced Options selected. Selecting this checkbox forces the
modbus client to wait for a response before sending the next request. This mode is
required by some fieldbus units. Turning this option on may help when there are multiple
signals, and increasing request frequency results in signal disconnects.
The actual signal frequency may be lower than requested when multiple signals are
defined in sequential mode. Actual signal frequency can be observed in signal statistics.
The signal indicator turns yellow if the actual signal frequency is less than half of the value
selected from the Frequency drop-down list.

Add signal Push this button to add a signal to the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Delete
signal

Push this button to delete a MODBUS signal from the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Set
sig
nal
type

Use this drop down menu to choose the signal type.
Available types are:

Digital input
A digital input (coil) is a one-bit quantity which is read from the
MODBUS unit on the coil specified in the address field of the signal.
Function code 0x02 (Read Discrete Inputs) is used.

Digital output

A digital output (coil) is a one-bit quantity which can be set to either
high or low. Before the value of this output has been set by the user,
the value is read from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that
function code 0x01 (Read Coils) is used. When the output has been
set by a robot program or by pressing the set signal value button,
the function code 0x05 (Write Single Coil) is used onwards.

Register input

A register input is a 16-bit quantity read from the address specified
in the address field. The function code 0x04 (Read Input Registers)
is used.

Register output

A register output is a 16-bit quantity which can be set by the user.
Before the value of the register has been set, the value of it is read
from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that function code 0x03
(Read Holding Registers) is used. When the output has been set by
a robot program or by specifying a signal value in the set signal
value field, function code 0x06 (Write Single Register) is used to set
the value on the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
address

This field shows the address on the remote MODBUS server. Use the on-screen keypad to
choose a different address. Valid addresses depends on the manufacturer and configuration
of the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
name

Using the on-screen keyboard, the user can give the signal a name. This name is used when
the signal is used in programs.

Signal
value

Here, the current value of the signal is shown. For register signals, the value is expressed as
an unsigned integer. For output signals, the desired signal value can be set using the button.
Again, for a register output, the value to write to the unit must be supplied as an unsigned
integer.

Update Frequency

This menu can be used to change the update frequency of the
signal. This means the frequency with which requests are sent to
the remote MODBUS unit for either reading or writing the signal
value. When the frequency is set to 0, then modbus requests are
initiated on demand using a modbus_get_signal_status,
modbus_set_output_register, and modbus_set_output_signal
script functions.

Slave Address

This text field can be used to set a specific slave address for the
requests corresponding to a specific signal. The value must be in
the range 0-255 both included, and the default is 255. If you
change this value, it is recommended to consult the manual of
the remote MODBUS device to verify its functionality when
changing slave address.

Reconnect count
Number of times TCP connection was closed, and connected
again.

Connection status TCP connection status.

Response time [ms]
Time between modbus request sent, and response received -
this is updated only when communication is active.

Modbus packet errors
Number of received packets that contained errors (i.e. invalid
length, missing data, TCP socket error).

Timeouts Number of modbus requests that didn’t get response.

Requests failed
Number of packets that could not be sent due to invalid socket
status.

Actual freq.
The average frequency of client (master) signal status updates.
This value is recalculated each time the signal receives a
response from the server (or slave).

All counters count up to 65535, and then wrap back to 0.

12.5. PROFIsafe

Description The PROFIsafe network protocol (implemented as version 2.6.1) allows the robot to
communicate with a safety PLC according to ISO 13849, Cat 3 PLd requirements. The
robot transmits safety state information to a safety PLC, then receives information to
trigger safety related functions, such as: emergency stop or enter reduced mode.
The PROFIsafe interface provides a safe, network-based alternative to connecting wires
to the safety IO pins of the robot control box.
PROFIsafe is only available on robots that have an enabling license, which you can
obtain by contacting your local sales representative, once obtained, the license can be
downloaded on myUR.
Please refer to Robot Registration and URCap License files for information regarding
robot registration and license activation.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

Mode
When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety
level. Checks must adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations. The
correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.
The purpose of maintenance and repair work is to ensure that the system is kept
operational or, in the event of a fault, to return the system to an operational state. Repair
work includes troubleshooting in addition to the actual repair itself.
When working on the robot arm or control box, you must observe the procedures and
warnings below.

Warning
WARNING

Failure to adhere to any of the safety practices, listed below, can result in
injury.

• Unplug the main power cable from the bottom of the Control Box to
ensure that it is completely unpowered. Power off any other source
of energy connected to the robot arm or Control Box. Take
necessary precautions to prevent other persons from powering on
the system during the repair period.

• Check the earth connection before re-powering the system.

• Observe ESD regulations when parts of the robot arm or Control Box
are disassembled.

15.1. Testing Stopping Performance

Description Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded. Increased stopping
times can require safeguarding to be modified, possibly with changes to the installation.
If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used and are the basis of the risk
reduction strategy, no monitoring or testing of stopping performance is required. The
robot does continuous monitoring.

15.2. Robot ArmCleaning and Inspection

Description As part of regular maintenance the robot arm can be cleaned, in accordance with the
recommendations in this manual and local requirements.

Cleaning
Methods

To address the dust, dirt, or oil on the robot arm and/or Teach Pendant, simply use a cloth
alongside one of the cleaning agents provided below.

Surface Preparation: Before applying the below solutions, surfaces may need to be
prepared by removing any loose dirt or debris.

Cleaning agents:

• Water

• 70% Isopropyl alcohol

• 10% Ethanol alcohol

• 10% Naphtha (Use to remove grease.)

Application: The solution is typically applied to the surface that needs cleaning using a
spray bottle, brush, sponge, or cloth. It can be applied directly or diluted further depending
on the level of contamination and the type of surface being cleaned.
Agitation: For stubborn stains or heavily soiled areas, the solution may be agitated using
a brush, scrubber, or other mechanical means to help loosen the contaminants.
Dwell Time: If necessary, the solution is allowed to dwell on the surface for a up to 5
minutes to penetrate and dissolve the contaminants effectively.
Rinsing: After the dwell time, the surface is typically rinsed thoroughly with water to
remove the dissolved contaminants and any remaining cleaning agent residue. It&#x27;s
essential to ensure thorough rinsing to prevent any residue from causing damage or
posing a safety hazard.
Drying: Finally, the cleaned surface may be left to air dry or dried using towels.

WARNING

DO NOT USE BLEACH in any diluted cleaning solution.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description The risk assessment is a requirement that shall be performed for the application. The

application risk assessment is the responsibility of the integrator. The user can also be
the integrator.

The robot is partly completed machinery, as such the safety of the robot application
depends on the tool/end effector, obstacles and other machines. The party performing
the integration must use ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 to conduct the risk assessment.
Technical Specification ISO/TS 15066 can provide additional guidance for collaborative
applications. The risk assessment shall consider all tasks throughout the lifetime of the
robot application, including but not limited to:

• Teaching the robot during set-up and development of the robot application

• Troubleshooting and maintenance

• Normal operation of the robot application

A risk assessment must be conducted before the robot application is powered on for the
first time. The risk assessment is an iterative process. After physically installing the
robot, verify the connections, then complete the integration. A part of the risk
assessment is to determine the safety configuration settings, as well as the need for
additional emergency stops and/or other protective measures required for the specific
robot application.

Safety
configuration
settings

Identifying the correct safety configuration settings is a particularly important part of
developing robot applications. Unauthorized access to the safety configuration must be
prevented by enabling and setting password protection.

WARNING

Failure to set password protection can result in injury or death due to
purposeful or inadvertent changes to configuration settings.

• Always set password protection.

• Set up a program for managing passwords, so that access is
only by persons who understand the effect of changes.

Some safety functions are purposely designed for collaborative robot applications.
These are configurable through the safety configuration settings. They are used to
address risks identified in the application risk assessment.

The following limit the robot and as such can affect the energy transfer to a person by
the robot arm, end effector and workpiece.

• Force and power limiting: Used to reduce clamping forces and pressures
exerted by the robot in the direction of movement in case of collisions between
the robot and the operator.

• Momentum limiting: Used to reduce high transient energy and impact forces in
case of collisions between robot and operator by reducing the speed of the robot.

• Speed limitation: Used to ensure the speed is less that the configured limit.

The following orientation settings are used to avoid movements and reduce exposure of
sharp edges and protrusions to a person.

• Joint, elbow and tool/end effector position limiting: Used to reduce risks
associated with certain body parts: Avoid movement towards head and neck.

• Tool/end effector orientation limiting: Used to reduce risks associated with
certain areas and features of the tool/end effector and work-piece: Avoid sharp
edges being pointed towards the operator, by turning the sharp edges inward
towards the robot.

Stopping
performance
risks

Some safety functions are purposely designed for any robot application. These features
are configurable through the safety configuration settings. They are used to address
risks associated with the stopping performance of the robot application.

The following limit the robot stopping time and stopping distance to ensure stopping will
occur before reaching the configured limits. Both settings automatically affect the speed
of the robot to ensure the limit is not exceeded.

• Stopping Time Limit: Used to limit the stopping time of the robot.

• Stopping Distance Limit: Used to limit the stopping distance of the robot.

If either of the above is used, there is no need for manually performed periodic stopping
performance testing. The robot safety control does continuous monitoring.

If the robot is installed in a robot application where hazards cannot be reasonably eliminated or
risks cannot be sufficiently reduced by use of the built-in safety-related functions (e.g. when
using a hazardous tool/end effector,or hazardous process), then safeguarding is required. See
ISO 10218-2.

WARNING

Failure to conduct a application risk assessment can increase risks.

• Always conduct an application risk assessment for foreseeable risks
and reasonably foreseeable misuse.

For collaborative applications, the risk assessment includes the
foreseeable risks due to collisions and to reasonably foreseeable
misuse.

The risk assessment shall address:

• Severity of harm

• Likelihood of occurrence

• Possibility to avoid the hazardous situation

Potential
Hazards

Universal Robots identifies the potential significant hazards listed below for consideration
by the integrator. Other significant hazards can be associated with a specific robot
application.

• Penetration of skin by sharp edges and sharp points on tool/end effector or
tool/end effector connector.

• Penetration of skin by sharp edges and sharp points on nearby obstacles.

• Bruising due to contact.

• Sprain or bone fracture due to impact.

• Consequences due to loose bolts that hold the robot arm or tool/end effector.

• Items falling out of, or flying from the tool/end effector, e.g. due to a poor grip or
power interruption.

• Mistaken understanding of what is controlled by multiple emergency stop buttons.

• Incorrect setting of the safety configuration parameters.

• Incorrect settings due to unauthorized changes to the safety configuration
parameters.

Description You can avoid pinching hazards by removing obstacles in these areas, by placing the
robot differently, or by using a combination of safety planes and joint limits to eliminate
the hazards by preventing the robot moving into this area of its workspace.

CAUTION

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can
lead to injury.

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require
attention regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when
the wrist 1 joint is at least 750 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is

within 200 mm of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s

12.2. MODBUS

Description Here, the MODBUS client (master) signals can be set up. Connections to MODBUS
servers (or slaves) on specified IP addresses can be created with input/output signals
(registers or digital). Each signal has a unique name so it can be used in programs.

Refresh Push this button to refresh all MODBUS connections. Refreshing disconnects all modbus
units, and connects them back again. All statistics are cleared.

Add unit Push this button to add a new MODBUS unit.

Delete unit Push this button to delete the MODBUS unit and all signals on that unit.

Set unit IP Here the IP address of the MODBUS unit is shown. Press the button to change it.

Sequential
mode

Available only when Show Advanced Options selected. Selecting this checkbox forces the
modbus client to wait for a response before sending the next request. This mode is
required by some fieldbus units. Turning this option on may help when there are multiple
signals, and increasing request frequency results in signal disconnects.
The actual signal frequency may be lower than requested when multiple signals are
defined in sequential mode. Actual signal frequency can be observed in signal statistics.
The signal indicator turns yellow if the actual signal frequency is less than half of the value
selected from the Frequency drop-down list.

Add signal Push this button to add a signal to the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Delete
signal

Push this button to delete a MODBUS signal from the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Set
sig
nal
type

Use this drop down menu to choose the signal type.
Available types are:

Digital input
A digital input (coil) is a one-bit quantity which is read from the
MODBUS unit on the coil specified in the address field of the signal.
Function code 0x02 (Read Discrete Inputs) is used.

Digital output

A digital output (coil) is a one-bit quantity which can be set to either
high or low. Before the value of this output has been set by the user,
the value is read from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that
function code 0x01 (Read Coils) is used. When the output has been
set by a robot program or by pressing the set signal value button,
the function code 0x05 (Write Single Coil) is used onwards.

Register input

A register input is a 16-bit quantity read from the address specified
in the address field. The function code 0x04 (Read Input Registers)
is used.

Register output

A register output is a 16-bit quantity which can be set by the user.
Before the value of the register has been set, the value of it is read
from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that function code 0x03
(Read Holding Registers) is used. When the output has been set by
a robot program or by specifying a signal value in the set signal
value field, function code 0x06 (Write Single Register) is used to set
the value on the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
address

This field shows the address on the remote MODBUS server. Use the on-screen keypad to
choose a different address. Valid addresses depends on the manufacturer and configuration
of the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
name

Using the on-screen keyboard, the user can give the signal a name. This name is used when
the signal is used in programs.

Signal
value

Here, the current value of the signal is shown. For register signals, the value is expressed as
an unsigned integer. For output signals, the desired signal value can be set using the button.
Again, for a register output, the value to write to the unit must be supplied as an unsigned
integer.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

15.1. Testing Stopping Performance

Description Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded. Increased stopping
times can require safeguarding to be modified, possibly with changes to the installation.
If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used and are the basis of the risk
reduction strategy, no monitoring or testing of stopping performance is required. The
robot does continuous monitoring.

15.2. Robot ArmCleaning and Inspection

Description As part of regular maintenance the robot arm can be cleaned, in accordance with the
recommendations in this manual and local requirements.

Cleaning
Methods

To address the dust, dirt, or oil on the robot arm and/or Teach Pendant, simply use a cloth
alongside one of the cleaning agents provided below.

Surface Preparation: Before applying the below solutions, surfaces may need to be
prepared by removing any loose dirt or debris.

Cleaning agents:

• Water

• 70% Isopropyl alcohol

• 10% Ethanol alcohol

• 10% Naphtha (Use to remove grease.)

Application: The solution is typically applied to the surface that needs cleaning using a
spray bottle, brush, sponge, or cloth. It can be applied directly or diluted further depending
on the level of contamination and the type of surface being cleaned.
Agitation: For stubborn stains or heavily soiled areas, the solution may be agitated using
a brush, scrubber, or other mechanical means to help loosen the contaminants.
Dwell Time: If necessary, the solution is allowed to dwell on the surface for a up to 5
minutes to penetrate and dissolve the contaminants effectively.
Rinsing: After the dwell time, the surface is typically rinsed thoroughly with water to
remove the dissolved contaminants and any remaining cleaning agent residue. It&#x27;s
essential to ensure thorough rinsing to prevent any residue from causing damage or
posing a safety hazard.
Drying: Finally, the cleaned surface may be left to air dry or dried using towels.

WARNING

DO NOT USE BLEACH in any diluted cleaning solution.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

Table The functional difference is shown below.

Safety
caution

Use the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop
Output. Configuring a set of configurable I/O for safety functions are done through the GUI,
(see part Part II PolyScope Manual).

CAUTION

Failure to verify and test the safety functions regularly can lead to
hazardous situations.

• Safety functions shall be verified before putting the robot into
operation.

• Safety functions shall be tested regularly.

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

3-position enabling device.
When in teach/program, initially both TCP speed and elbow speed will
be limited to 250mm/s. The speed can manually be increased by using
the pendant user interface “speed-slider”, but upon activation of the

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

12.2. MODBUS

Description Here, the MODBUS client (master) signals can be set up. Connections to MODBUS
servers (or slaves) on specified IP addresses can be created with input/output signals
(registers or digital). Each signal has a unique name so it can be used in programs.

Refresh Push this button to refresh all MODBUS connections. Refreshing disconnects all modbus
units, and connects them back again. All statistics are cleared.

Add unit Push this button to add a new MODBUS unit.

Delete unit Push this button to delete the MODBUS unit and all signals on that unit.

Set unit IP Here the IP address of the MODBUS unit is shown. Press the button to change it.

Sequential
mode

Available only when Show Advanced Options selected. Selecting this checkbox forces the
modbus client to wait for a response before sending the next request. This mode is
required by some fieldbus units. Turning this option on may help when there are multiple
signals, and increasing request frequency results in signal disconnects.
The actual signal frequency may be lower than requested when multiple signals are
defined in sequential mode. Actual signal frequency can be observed in signal statistics.
The signal indicator turns yellow if the actual signal frequency is less than half of the value
selected from the Frequency drop-down list.

Add signal Push this button to add a signal to the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Delete
signal

Push this button to delete a MODBUS signal from the corresponding MODBUS unit.

Set
sig
nal
type

Use this drop down menu to choose the signal type.
Available types are:

Digital input
A digital input (coil) is a one-bit quantity which is read from the
MODBUS unit on the coil specified in the address field of the signal.
Function code 0x02 (Read Discrete Inputs) is used.

Digital output

A digital output (coil) is a one-bit quantity which can be set to either
high or low. Before the value of this output has been set by the user,
the value is read from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that
function code 0x01 (Read Coils) is used. When the output has been
set by a robot program or by pressing the set signal value button,
the function code 0x05 (Write Single Coil) is used onwards.

Register input

A register input is a 16-bit quantity read from the address specified
in the address field. The function code 0x04 (Read Input Registers)
is used.

Register output

A register output is a 16-bit quantity which can be set by the user.
Before the value of the register has been set, the value of it is read
from the remote MODBUS unit. This means that function code 0x03
(Read Holding Registers) is used. When the output has been set by
a robot program or by specifying a signal value in the set signal
value field, function code 0x06 (Write Single Register) is used to set
the value on the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
address

This field shows the address on the remote MODBUS server. Use the on-screen keypad to
choose a different address. Valid addresses depends on the manufacturer and configuration
of the remote MODBUS unit.

Set signal
name

Using the on-screen keyboard, the user can give the signal a name. This name is used when
the signal is used in programs.

Signal
value

Here, the current value of the signal is shown. For register signals, the value is expressed as
an unsigned integer. For output signals, the desired signal value can be set using the button.
Again, for a register output, the value to write to the unit must be supplied as an unsigned
integer.

Update Frequency

This menu can be used to change the update frequency of the
signal. This means the frequency with which requests are sent to
the remote MODBUS unit for either reading or writing the signal
value. When the frequency is set to 0, then modbus requests are
initiated on demand using a modbus_get_signal_status,
modbus_set_output_register, and modbus_set_output_signal
script functions.

Slave Address

This text field can be used to set a specific slave address for the
requests corresponding to a specific signal. The value must be in
the range 0-255 both included, and the default is 255. If you
change this value, it is recommended to consult the manual of
the remote MODBUS device to verify its functionality when
changing slave address.

Reconnect count
Number of times TCP connection was closed, and connected
again.

Connection status TCP connection status.

Response time [ms]
Time between modbus request sent, and response received -
this is updated only when communication is active.

Modbus packet errors
Number of received packets that contained errors (i.e. invalid
length, missing data, TCP socket error).

Timeouts Number of modbus requests that didn’t get response.

Requests failed
Number of packets that could not be sent due to invalid socket
status.

Actual freq.
The average frequency of client (master) signal status updates.
This value is recalculated each time the signal receives a
response from the server (or slave).

All counters count up to 65535, and then wrap back to 0.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

Mode
When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Safety for
Maintenance

After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety
level. Checks must adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations. The
correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.
The purpose of maintenance and repair work is to ensure that the system is kept
operational or, in the event of a fault, to return the system to an operational state. Repair
work includes troubleshooting in addition to the actual repair itself.
When working on the robot arm or control box, you must observe the procedures and
warnings below.

Warning
WARNING

Failure to adhere to any of the safety practices, listed below, can result in
injury.

• Unplug the main power cable from the bottom of the Control Box to
ensure that it is completely unpowered. Power off any other source
of energy connected to the robot arm or Control Box. Take
necessary precautions to prevent other persons from powering on
the system during the repair period.

• Check the earth connection before re-powering the system.

• Observe ESD regulations when parts of the robot arm or Control Box
are disassembled.

• Prevent water and dust from entering the robot arm or Control Box.

Warning:
Electricity WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Disassembling the Control Box power supply too quickly after switching
off, can result in injury due to electrical hazards.

• Avoid disassembling the power supply inside the Control Box, as
high voltages (up to 600 V) can be present inside these power

15.1. Testing Stopping Performance

Description Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded. Increased stopping
times can require safeguarding to be modified, possibly with changes to the installation.
If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used and are the basis of the risk
reduction strategy, no monitoring or testing of stopping performance is required. The
robot does continuous monitoring.

15.2. Robot ArmCleaning and Inspection

Description As part of regular maintenance the robot arm can be cleaned, in accordance with the
recommendations in this manual and local requirements.

Cleaning
Methods

To address the dust, dirt, or oil on the robot arm and/or Teach Pendant, simply use a cloth
alongside one of the cleaning agents provided below.

Surface Preparation: Before applying the below solutions, surfaces may need to be
prepared by removing any loose dirt or debris.

Cleaning agents:

• Water

• 70% Isopropyl alcohol

• 10% Ethanol alcohol

• 10% Naphtha (Use to remove grease.)

Application: The solution is typically applied to the surface that needs cleaning using a
spray bottle, brush, sponge, or cloth. It can be applied directly or diluted further depending
on the level of contamination and the type of surface being cleaned.
Agitation: For stubborn stains or heavily soiled areas, the solution may be agitated using
a brush, scrubber, or other mechanical means to help loosen the contaminants.
Dwell Time: If necessary, the solution is allowed to dwell on the surface for a up to 5
minutes to penetrate and dissolve the contaminants effectively.
Rinsing: After the dwell time, the surface is typically rinsed thoroughly with water to
remove the dissolved contaminants and any remaining cleaning agent residue. It&#x27;s
essential to ensure thorough rinsing to prevent any residue from causing damage or
posing a safety hazard.
Drying: Finally, the cleaned surface may be left to air dry or dried using towels.

WARNING

DO NOT USE BLEACH in any diluted cleaning solution.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.
