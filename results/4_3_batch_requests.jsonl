This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 182 UR5e\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\r\nprograms and installations.\r\n\r\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\r\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\r\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\r\n\r\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\r\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\r\n\r\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\r\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\r\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot\u2019s moving space.\r\n\r\nMode\r\nswitching\r\n\r\nOperational mode Manual Automatic\r\n\r\nFreedrive x *\r\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab x *\r\nEdit &amp; save program &amp; installation x\r\n\r\nExecute Programs\r\nReduced\r\nspeed**\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStart program from selected node x\r\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\r\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\r\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 184 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice when\r\nswitching\r\nmode\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\u2022 Some UR\u00a0robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device.

Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

Tool Direction Restriction\r\n\r\nDescription The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.\r\nThe limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm\r\nBase. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\r\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\r\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the\r\ngraphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.\r\n\r\nUR5e 131 User Manual\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTool Position\r\nWarning\r\n\r\nYou must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger\r\ncorrectly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.\r\nThe warning remains on the Tool Position if:\r\n\r\n\u2022 You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.\r\n\r\nTo configure the tool position\r\n\r\n1.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2.

Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text.

The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\r\nprograms and installations.\r\n\r\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\r\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\r\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\r\n\r\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\r\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\r\n\r\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\r\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\r\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot\u2019s moving space.\r\n\r\nMode\r\nswitching\r\n\r\nOperational mode Manual Automatic\r\n\r\nFreedrive x *\r\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab x *\r\nEdit &amp; save program &amp; installation x\r\n\r\nExecute Programs\r\nReduced\r\nspeed**\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStart program from selected node x\r\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\r\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\r\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 184 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice when\r\nswitching\r\nmode\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\u2022 Some UR\u00a0robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

This will\r\nallow extra distance for the tool to move.\r\n\r\nRestricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature.

As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\r\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The\r\nfeature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend\r\nyou create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nonce the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off\r\nmaking it impossible to define new features.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 128 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimit\r\nPrope\r\nrties\r\n\r\nThe Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:\r\n\r\n1.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\r\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\r\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm.

OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs\r\nactive/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on\r\nthe safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected\r\nto a supply and shuts down the robot.\r\nThe illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length\r\n(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)\r\n\r\nTo enable OSSD for Safety Output\r\n\r\n1.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

This will\r\nallow extra distance for the tool to move.\r\n\r\nRestricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature.

As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\r\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The\r\nfeature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend\r\nyou create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nonce the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off\r\nmaking it impossible to define new features.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 128 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimit\r\nPrope\r\nrties\r\n\r\nThe Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:\r\n\r\n1.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\r\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\r\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm.

OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs\r\nactive/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on\r\nthe safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected\r\nto a supply and shuts down the robot.\r\nThe illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length\r\n(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)\r\n\r\nTo enable OSSD for Safety Output\r\n\r\n1.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration.

This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable.

Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or\r\nthe Dashboard Server.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined\r\ntasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2.

The user can also be\r\nthe integrator.\r\n\r\nThe robot is partly completed machinery, as such the safety of the robot application\r\ndepends on the tool/end effector, obstacles and other machines. The party performing\r\nthe integration must use ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 to conduct the risk assessment.\r\nTechnical Specification ISO/TS 15066 can provide additional guidance for collaborative\r\napplications. The risk assessment shall consider all tasks throughout the lifetime of the\r\nrobot application, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Teaching the robot during set-up and development of the robot application\r\n\r\n\u2022 Troubleshooting and maintenance\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal operation of the robot application\r\n\r\nA risk assessment must be conducted before the robot application is powered on for the\r\nfirst time. The risk assessment is an iterative process. After physically installing the\r\nrobot, verify the connections, then complete the integration. A part of the risk\r\nassessment is to determine the safety configuration settings, as well as the need for\r\nadditional emergency stops and/or other protective measures required for the specific\r\nrobot application.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 34 UR5e\r\n\r\n4.\u00a0Risk Assessment\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nconfiguration\r\nsettings\r\n\r\nIdentifying the correct safety configuration settings is a particularly important part of\r\ndeveloping robot applications.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 182 UR5e\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\r\nprograms and installations.\r\n\r\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\r\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\r\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\r\n\r\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\r\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\r\n\r\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\r\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\r\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot\u2019s moving space.\r\n\r\nMode\r\nswitching\r\n\r\nOperational mode Manual Automatic\r\n\r\nFreedrive x *\r\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab x *\r\nEdit &amp; save program &amp; installation x\r\n\r\nExecute Programs\r\nReduced\r\nspeed**\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStart program from selected node x\r\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\r\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\r\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 184 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice when\r\nswitching\r\nmode\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\u2022 Some UR\u00a0robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device.

Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

Tool Direction Restriction\r\n\r\nDescription The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.\r\nThe limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm\r\nBase. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\r\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\r\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the\r\ngraphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.\r\n\r\nUR5e 131 User Manual\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTool Position\r\nWarning\r\n\r\nYou must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger\r\ncorrectly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.\r\nThe warning remains on the Tool Position if:\r\n\r\n\u2022 You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.\r\n\r\nTo configure the tool position\r\n\r\n1.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\r\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The\r\nfeature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend\r\nyou create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nonce the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off\r\nmaking it impossible to define new features.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 128 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimit\r\nPrope\r\nrties\r\n\r\nThe Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:\r\n\r\n1.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text.

The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

It can be applied directly or diluted further depending\r\non the level of contamination and the type of surface being cleaned.\r\nAgitation: For stubborn stains or heavily soiled areas, the solution may be agitated using\r\na brush, scrubber, or other mechanical means to help loosen the contaminants.\r\nDwell Time: If necessary, the solution is allowed to dwell on the surface for a up to 5\r\nminutes to penetrate and dissolve the contaminants effectively.\r\nRinsing: After the dwell time, the surface is typically rinsed thoroughly with water to\r\nremove the dissolved contaminants and any remaining cleaning agent residue. It&#x27;s\r\nessential to ensure thorough rinsing to prevent any residue from causing damage or\r\nposing a safety hazard.\r\nDrying: Finally, the cleaned surface may be left to air dry or dried using towels.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDO\u00a0NOT\u00a0USE BLEACH in any diluted cleaning solution.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 194 UR5e\r\n\r\n15.\u00a0Maintenance and Repair\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nGrease is an irritant and can cause an allergic reaction.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\r\nprograms and installations.\r\n\r\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\r\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\r\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\r\n\r\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\r\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\r\n\r\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\r\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\r\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot\u2019s moving space.\r\n\r\nMode\r\nswitching\r\n\r\nOperational mode Manual Automatic\r\n\r\nFreedrive x *\r\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab x *\r\nEdit &amp; save program &amp; installation x\r\n\r\nExecute Programs\r\nReduced\r\nspeed**\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStart program from selected node x\r\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\r\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\r\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 184 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice when\r\nswitching\r\nmode\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\u2022 Some UR\u00a0robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device.

Each safety function and I/O is\r\nconstructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d\r\n(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.\r\nSee Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and\r\noutputs in the user interface.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\r\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text.

The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name.

However, the safety I/O\u00a0must be kept as two separate branches.\r\n\r\nThe permanent safety input types are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only\r\n\r\n\u2022 Safeguard Stop for protective devices\r\n\r\n\u2022 3PE Stop for protective devices\r\n\r\nTable The functional difference is shown below.\r\n\r\nEmergency\r\nStop\r\n\r\nSafeguard Stop 3PE Stop\r\n\r\nRobot stops moving Yes Yes Yes\r\nProgram execution Pauses Pauses Pauses\r\nDrive power Off On On\r\n\r\nReset Manual\r\nAutomatic or\r\nmanual\r\n\r\nAutomatic or\r\nmanual\r\n\r\nFrequency of use Infrequent\r\nEvery cycle to\r\ninfrequent\r\n\r\nEvery cycle to\r\ninfrequent\r\n\r\nRequires re-initialization\r\nBrake release\r\n\r\nonly\r\nNo No\r\n\r\nStop Category (IEC\u00a060204-1) 1 2 2\r\nPerformance level of monitoring\r\nfunction (ISO\u00a013849-1)\r\n\r\nPLd PLd PLd\r\n\r\nSafety\r\ncaution\r\n\r\nUse the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop\r\nOutput.

The safety input is sampled every millisecond and\r\nthe state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7\r\nmilliseconds.\r\n\r\nOSSD\r\nSafety\r\nSignals\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is\r\ninactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs\r\nactive/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on\r\nthe safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected\r\nto a supply and shuts down the robot.\r\nThe illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length\r\n(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)\r\n\r\nTo enable OSSD for Safety Output\r\n\r\n1.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

Otherwise, the signal is Low.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nAny external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot\r\nthrough the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed.

Software Safety Restrictions\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you\r\ncreate and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nthe robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and\r\nmoving the robot will be impossible.\r\n\r\nSafety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,\r\nrestricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each\r\nsafety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,\r\nyou must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the\r\nsafety plane screen and configured.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nDefining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,\r\nnot the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a\r\nsafety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will\r\nobey this restriction.\r\n\r\nSaf\r\nety\r\nPla\r\nnes\r\nMod\r\nes\r\n\r\nYou can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.\r\n\r\nDisabled The safety plane is never active in this state.\r\n\r\nNormal\r\nWhen the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is\r\nactive and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nReduced\r\nWhen the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode\r\nplane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.\r\n\r\nNormal &amp; Reduced\r\nWhen the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,\r\na normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict\r\nlimit on the position.\r\n\r\nTrigger Reduced\r\nMode\r\n\r\nThe safety plane causes the safety system to switch to\r\nReduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShow\r\nPressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the\r\ngraphics pane.\r\n\r\nDelete\r\nDeletes the created safety plane.

This will\r\nallow extra distance for the tool to move.\r\n\r\nRestricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature.

As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the\r\ndefined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output\r\nflange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.\r\nBefore configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The\r\nfeature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend\r\nyou create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as\r\nonce the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off\r\nmaking it impossible to define new features.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 128 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimit\r\nPrope\r\nrties\r\n\r\nThe Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:\r\n\r\n1.

The radius is considered when using\r\nsafety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the\r\nrobot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere\r\nfrom passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.\r\nThe position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping\r\ndistance and safety planes.\r\n\r\nYou can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of\r\nthe existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool\r\nPosition menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.\r\nWhen you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP\r\nvisible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference\r\nbetween the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the\r\ndrop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.\r\nThe selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.\r\nOnce you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the\r\nTCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This\r\nindicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated\r\nto reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by\r\npressing the sync icon (see\u00a0).\r\nThe TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.\r\nYou can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can\r\nalso determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm.

OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs\r\nactive/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on\r\nthe safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected\r\nto a supply and shuts down the robot.\r\nThe illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length\r\n(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)\r\n\r\nTo enable OSSD for Safety Output\r\n\r\n1.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration.

This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable.

Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the\r\nsafety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm\r\ndecelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.\r\nThe safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less\r\nthan 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to\r\nviolate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger\r\nplanes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The\r\nsafety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.\r\n\r\n3-Position\r\nEnabling\r\nDevice\r\n\r\nIn Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be\r\npressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are\r\nusing a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed\r\nand held in the mid position to move the robot.\r\n\r\nFreedrive on\r\nrobot\r\n\r\nYou can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive\r\nwithout pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without\r\nhaving to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-\r\npress position.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 66 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput\r\nSignals Operational\r\n\r\nMode\r\nWhen defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic\r\nMode and Manual Mode.\r\n\r\nSafeguard\r\nReset\r\n\r\nWhen a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the\r\nSafeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.\r\n\r\nAutomatic\r\nMode\r\nSafeguard\r\nStop\r\n\r\nOnce configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a\r\nSafeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the\r\nrobot is in Automatic mode.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\u2022 If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no\r\nlonger Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high.

This\r\nis particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is\r\nconnected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System\r\nEmergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop\r\ndevice is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external\r\nmachinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot\u2019s\r\noperator.

This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3.

MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or\r\nthe Dashboard Server.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined\r\ntasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot.

If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded.

Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2.

Configurable Safety Functions\r\n\r\nDescription Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but\r\nare meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.\r\nThe robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk\r\nassessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nJoint Position\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\r\n\r\nJoint Speed\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nPlanes\r\n\r\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\r\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\nTool\r\nOrientation\r\n\r\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\r\n\r\nSpeed Limit\r\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\r\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\r\neffector positions.\r\n\r\nForce Limit\r\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\r\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\r\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\r\n\r\nMomentum\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximummomentum of the robot.\r\n\r\nPower Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.\r\nStopping\r\nTime Limit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.1\r\n\r\nStopping\r\nDistance\r\nLimit\r\n\r\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nFunction\r\n\r\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\r\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\r\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\r\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\r\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\r\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\r\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\r\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.\r\n\r\nUR5e 101 User Manual\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Function Accuracy Performance Level Category\r\n\r\nEmergency Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nSafeguard Stop \u2013 d 3\r\nJoint Position Limit 5\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nJoint Speed Limit 1.15\u00a0\u00b0/s d 3\r\nSafety Planes 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nTool Orientation 3\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\nSpeed Limit 50\u00a0mm/s d 3\r\nForce Limit 25\u00a0N d 3\r\nMomentum Limit 3\u00a0kg m/s d 3\r\nPower Limit 10\u00a0W d 3\r\nStopping Time Limit 50\u00a0ms d 3\r\nStopping Distance Limit 40\u00a0mm d 3\r\nSafe Home 1.7\u00a0\u00b0 d 3\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nCAUTION\r\n\r\nFailure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear\r\nmovements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250\u00a0mm/s for\r\nthe tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows\r\nthat higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast\r\nmovements of the robot elbow near singularities.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nThere are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important\r\nwhen designing an application.\r\nAs the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the\r\nradial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short\r\nleverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving\r\naround the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 102 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkspace\r\n\r\nFront Tilted\r\n\r\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\r\nregarding pinching hazards.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.

Software SafetyModes\r\n\r\nDescription Under normal conditions, i.e.\u00a0when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates\r\nin a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned\r\nbeyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see\u00a0Software Safety Restrictions), or\r\nwhen triggered using a configurable input.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,\r\nthe robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint\r\nposition limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is\r\npowered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the\r\nrobot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of\r\nthe robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nLimits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled\r\nin Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back\r\nwithin the limits.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of\r\nsafety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits\r\nfor speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n10.3.6. Software Safety Limits\r\n\r\nDescription In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System\r\nreceives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are\r\nexceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop\r\nor by reducing the speed.\r\n\r\nRobot Limits\r\n\r\nDescription Robot Limits restrict general robot movements.

This section also describes how to manually\r\nmove the system without power.\r\n\r\n13.1. Emergency Stop\r\n\r\nDescription The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.\r\nPress the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the\r\nemergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).\r\nEmergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).\r\n\r\nEmergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.\r\nThe risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop\r\npush-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must\r\ncomply with ISO 13850.\r\nAfter an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,\r\neach time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button\r\nthat initiated the stop.\r\nBefore resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess\r\nthe reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the\r\napplication is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nTo reset the emergency stop push-button\r\n\r\n1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.\r\n\r\nYou should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.\r\n\r\n3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 182 UR5e\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power\r\n\r\nDescription In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or\r\nunwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.\r\n\r\nTo perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the\r\njoint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced\r\ntorque.\r\n\r\nPerforming forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one\r\nperson alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced\r\nback-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the\r\nrobot arm.\r\n\r\nSee the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n\r\nRisks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Support the robot arm before removing power.\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\nMoving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service\r\npurposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to\r\nproperty damage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the\r\nrobot can find its original physical position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not move any joint more than necessary.\r\n\r\nUR5e 183 User Manual\r\n\r\n13.\u00a0Emergency Events\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.3.

You cannot modify or save programs and installations.\r\nManual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save\r\nprograms and installations.\r\n\r\nHigh Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to\r\ntemporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.\r\nHold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.\r\n\r\nThe robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling\r\nDevice is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.\r\n\r\nSwitching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.\r\nWhen using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety\r\nplanes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot\u2019s moving space.\r\n\r\nMode\r\nswitching\r\n\r\nOperational mode Manual Automatic\r\n\r\nFreedrive x *\r\nMove robot with arrows on Move Tab x *\r\nEdit &amp; save program &amp; installation x\r\n\r\nExecute Programs\r\nReduced\r\nspeed**\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nStart program from selected node x\r\n*Only when no Three-Position Enabling Device is configured.\r\n** If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual\r\nReduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 184 UR5e\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice when\r\nswitching\r\nmode\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\u2022 Some UR\u00a0robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position\r\nEnabling Device.

The reduced configuration is\r\nactive when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced\r\nPlane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.\r\nUsing a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the\r\nside of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is\r\nconfigured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20\u00a0mm area around the trigger plane\r\nwhere both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane\r\nprevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.\r\nUsing an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,\r\nthe reduced configuration, up to 500\u00a0ms can elapse before the new limit values become\r\nactive. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the reduced configuration to normal\r\n\r\n\u2022 Switching from the normal configuration to reduced\r\n\r\nThe robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500\u00a0ms.\r\n\r\nUser Manual 106 UR5e\r\n\r\n10.\u00a0First Time Use\r\n\r\nC\r\nop\r\nyr\r\nig\r\nht\r\n\u00a9\r\n20\r\n09\r\n\u20132\r\n02\r\n4\r\nby\r\n\r\nU\r\nni\r\nve\r\nrs\r\nal\r\n\u00a0R\r\nob\r\not\r\ns\u00a0\r\nA\r\n/S\r\n.A\r\n\r\nll\r\nrig\r\nht\r\ns\r\nre\r\nse\r\nrv\r\ned\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.
