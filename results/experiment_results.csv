1) The question asks: How many safety modes the arm has and their names. So we look for mentions of “safety mode(s)” or named modes tied to the safety system.
2) In the provided facts:
- Safety Planes section defines modes tied to the safety system: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode.
- Tool Direction Restriction also maps limits to safety system modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
- Multiple references to “Normal mode” and “Reduced mode” explicitly describe safety system states.
3) Although the facts include much additional material (programming, specs, run tab, etc.), the presence of explicit safety modes and their names makes the facts relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s claim: “The robot safety system has three modes: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.”
2) Check the FACTS for safety system modes:
   - The safety system itself operates in Normal and Reduced modes (e.g., planes/limits are “active when the safety system is in Normal/Reduced mode”).
   - “Disabled” appears as a configuration state for specific safety functions (e.g., safety planes or tool direction limits) meaning that particular plane/limit is never active, not as a mode of the overall safety system.
3) Check available modes/states for safety planes and tool direction:
   - Safety planes list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode.
   - Tool Direction limit list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
   - This shows more than three states are available for these functions and that “Disabled” is a per-function state, not a global safety system mode.
4) Conclusion: The student conflates the safety system’s global modes (Normal and Reduced) with per-function states (Disabled), and omits other documented modes/states (Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode). Therefore the statement is not accurate and not fully grounded in the provided facts.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: (a) the number of safety modes the arm has, and (b) the names of each mode.
- The student answer states there are three modes and lists them: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.
- The response is concise and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary information.
- Including a reference does not detract from relevance and the content still clearly answers the question.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student also states there are three modes, which matches the count.
- However, for the names, the student lists Normal, Reduced, and Disabled. While Normal and Reduced match, ""Disabled"" does not match ""Recovery.""

- The QUESTION is about the Stopping Time Limit safety function and what happens if the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit (200 ms vs. 1000 ms).
- The FACTS explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses to stop after a stop is initiated.
- The FACTS also state the safety system reactions: when a safety limit is violated (Limit Violation), the system initiates a Stop Category 0, and elsewhere note that all safety outputs reset to low upon fault/violation.
- These items directly address the condition in the QUESTION (exceeding the stopping time limit) and the ensuing system behavior.
- While the FACTS include additional sections (e.g., fieldbus, MODBUS, PROFIsafe) that aren’t necessary to answer this specific question, criterion (2) says any related content makes the set relevant.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Reasoning:
1) Identify the relevant facts:
- Stopping Time Limit “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The safety system monitors safety limits, and a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- Stop Category 0 is defined as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.

2) Apply the facts to the scenario:
- If the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the actual stopping time is 1000 ms, the robot has exceeded a configured safety limit (i.e., a limit violation of the Stopping Time Limit).

3) Determine the safety reaction per the facts:
- A Limit Violation causes a Stop Category 0, which corresponds to immediate removal of power to the arm.

4) Check for hallucinations:
- The student’s statements and terminology (Stopping Time Limit, Limit Violation, Stop Category 0, immediate removal of power) match the provided facts. No unsupported claims are introduced.

Conclusion:
Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- The student states that this constitutes a limit violation and describes the resulting action: a Stop Category 0 with immediate power removal.
- This directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit and clearly explains the expected system behavior.
- The answer is concise, focused on the scenario, and adds a relevant detail (Stop Category 0) that helps clarify the outcome.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit set to 200 ms, but the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. This is a clear safety limit violation.
- According to the ground truth, the consequence of such a violation is that the robot arm will enter recovery mode because the safety limits have been violated.
- The student states that the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal) upon the violation. This outcome differs from the ground truth, which specifies entering recovery mode as the relevant system state/outcome.
- The student answer does not mention entering recovery mode and instead specifies a different response (Stop Category 0), which conflicts with the ground truth description of what happens.

- Scan the provided facts for matching concepts/keywords:
  - Directly relevant:
    - “Safety for Maintenance” explicitly states: After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level, and all safety functions shall be tested.
    - 15.1 Testing Stopping Performance: Advises periodic testing of stopping performance, with notes on when monitoring/testing is or isn’t required.
    - 15.2 Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection + Inspection Plan: Includes concrete checks (cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings) and a simple functional test in Freedrive to verify the arm can hold position.
    - Warnings about power-off, grounding, and ESD during maintenance are ancillary but tied to maintenance/repair context.
    - 15.3 Log Tab: Can be used to review errors/faults after changes—supportive to post-modification checks.

  - Possibly relevant depending on the nature of the modification:
    - Software Safety Restrictions (safety planes, tool direction/position restrictions): If the modification affects tools/end-effector geometry or workspace limits, these settings may need verification.
  
  - Largely unrelated to the specific question:
    - Cybersecurity sections (11.x), Program and Installation Manager (15.4), Accessing Robot Data (15.5), Assembly and mounting, workspace, dimensioning the stand, control box clearance, cable/mains connections. These do not address checks after a modification, though they are general setup/safety info.

The FACTS state: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Citing the need to follow the Service Manual and Chapter 5’s inspection plan for trained individuals matches the FACTS: maintenance/inspection/repair must follow the latest Service Manual; repairs should be done by UR or trained individuals per the Service Manual; Chapter 5 contains the full inspection plan.
- Powering down and unplugging the Control Box, observing ESD precautions, checking earth connection before re-powering, and testing safety functions after reassembly are all explicitly listed under the safety warnings in the Maintenance section.
- Performing the specific inspection items (flat rings, robot cable and connections, base and tool mounting bolts) and replacing any damaged parts aligns with the Robot Arm Inspection Plan and its checklist, including the instruction to replace worn/damaged flat rings.

- The ground truth states that after a modification, specific safety checks and tests must be performed (e.g., verifying safety I/O connections, testing emergency stops and brakes, safeguard inputs/resets, reduced mode indications, mode changes, enabling device behavior, and related outputs).
- The student answer affirms that checks are required after maintenance/repair/modification and explicitly mentions testing safety functions after reassembly. This aligns with the ground truth’s requirement to test safety functions.
- The student also adds general maintenance/repair procedures (powering down, ESD precautions, inspections), which do not conflict with the ground truth.

1) The question asks specifically about “safety modes” and their names.
2) In the provided facts, the Safety Planes “Modes” section explicitly lists safety-related modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. These reference the safety system states (Normal and Reduced) and how planes behave in those states.
3) The Tool Direction restriction section also uses the same safety mode options (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced).
4) Additional mode mentions (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode) are operational modes rather than safety modes, but they are still semantically related to “modes of the arm,” and the documents tie Reduced/Normal behavior to the safety system.
5) Although the facts include a lot of unrelated material (programming, program tree, specifications), they contain clear, keyword-matching and semantically relevant information about safety modes.

Conclusion: The facts are relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the relevant facts: In the “Safety Planes” section, the manual lists the configurable Modes for each safety plane as: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. It also clarifies these are plane configuration modes, not the robot’s “operational modes.” Separately, “operational modes” in the manual refer to Automatic and Manual (and Recovery/Backdrive contexts), while the “safety system” can be in Normal or Reduced states.
2. Compare to the student answer: The student lists four items—Normal, Reduced, Disabled, and Trigger Reduced Mode—omitting “Normal & Reduced.”
3. Check correctness of framing: The student states “the arm’s safety system has four operational safety modes,” which conflates concepts. The four items listed are safety plane configuration options, not “operational safety modes” of the arm or safety system. The manual’s “operational modes” are Automatic/Manual; the safety system states are Normal/Reduced; and the plane has five configuration modes.
4. Check for hallucination: The listed four terms do appear in the facts, so there is no invented mode. However, the omission of “Normal & Reduced” and the mischaracterization of what these modes represent make the statement inaccurate.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS state that if a safety limit is violated, the safety reaction is Stop Category 0, and if a fault is detected, the reaction is also Stop Category 0 (10.2.2 Safety Functions, Trigger/Reaction table).
- The description of Stop Category 0 as “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors” appears in the PROFIsafe status message definitions (12.5 PROFIsafe, status message “Stop, cat. 0”).
- The FACTS also specify that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low (10.2.2, NOTICE).
- Therefore, in the hypothetical where the Stopping Time Limit is set to 200 ms and the robot takes 1000 ms to stop, that constitutes a limit violation, which correctly maps to Stop Category 0 and resetting all safety outputs to low.

- While many other sections (e.g., cybersecurity, program manager, safety plane configuration, assembly details) are not directly about post-modification checks, the presence of multiple directly relevant items satisfies the relevance criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Core requirement after maintenance/repair
- Student: Says checks must be performed after maintenance/repair to ensure required safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
- Facts: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Match: Accurate.

2) Power isolation and grounding
- Student: Unplug main power before work and check earth connection before re-powering.
- Facts: “Unplug the main power cable… Check the earth connection before re-powering the system.”
- Match: Accurate.

3) Stopping performance testing
- Student: Recommends periodic stop-performance testing and notes continuous monitoring when stop time/distance safety functions are used.
- Facts: “Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded… If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used… no monitoring or testing… required. The robot does continuous monitoring.”
- Match: Accurate and complete.

4) Physical inspection checklist
- Student: Inspect robot cable and connections, base mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings; move to ZERO and follow inspection steps; rectify/replace unacceptable parts.
- Facts: The inspection plan specifies ZERO position, power off/disconnect, inspect cable, check base/tool bolts, inspect/replace flat rings, and rectify/replace unacceptable parts.
- Match: Accurate. Adding “any modified components” is a reasonable generalization and does not contradict the manual.

5) Functional check in Freedrive
- Student: Verify correct operation in Freedrive and that the arm maintains position without support and without activating Freedrive.
- Facts: Procedure describes entering Freedrive via 3PE, moving to horizontally elongated position, releasing, and verifying it maintains position without support and without Freedrive.
- Match: Accurate.

6) Warranty notice
- Student: If damage observed within warranty, contact the distributor.
- Facts: “If any damage is observed on a robot within the warranty period, contact the distributor…”
- Match: Accurate.

7) Hallucinations check
- The student did not introduce procedures, chemicals, cybersecurity, or other items outside the provided maintenance/inspection scope. All points map to the given text. The brief parenthetical “including modifications” is not contradicted and remains within the maintenance/repair context.

Conclusion

Grounded: True

The student’s answer stays within the provided facts and accurately reflects the manual’s guidance without adding unsupported information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify what the question asks: After modifying a robot arm, are there checks required? The expected answer is whether checks are needed and, ideally, what kinds.
2) Verify the student addressed this: The student clearly says “Yes” and specifies that checks must ensure safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
3) Assess helpfulness: The student lists concrete post-modification checks—power/earth, safety function tests (including stopping performance), physical inspection items, and a functional check (Freedrive/holding position). These directly help the user know what to do.
4) Assess concision and relevance: The bullets are focused on post-modification checks. The brief warranty note is slightly tangential but minimal and does not detract from relevance.

Conclusion: The answer is concise, relevant, and helps answer the question with actionable checks.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth specifies that, after a robot arm modification, a series of safety-related tests must be performed (verify safety I/O connections, test E-stops and brake engagement, safeguard inputs and reset, reduced mode indication on the screen, mode icon changes, 3-position enabling device behavior, system response to E-stop outputs, verification of various status outputs, and determining commissioning requirements).
- The student correctly states that checks are required after maintenance/repair/modification and mentions testing safety functions and stopping performance, which aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on post-modification safety testing.
- The student also adds power, physical inspection, and Freedrive functional checks. These additions do not conflict with the ground truth; they are extra recommendations.
- The student does not enumerate several specific checks listed in the ground truth (e.g., UI indicators, 3-position enabling device, explicit E-stop/brake tests, specific output signals). However, omission is not a contradiction, and the answer remains factually consistent with the ground truth’s core message that safety checks are required.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is factually accurate relative to the ground truth and contains no conflicting statements, though it is less specific.

   - “When the safety system is in Reduced mode …”
   - “Normal & Reduced”

- The question asks specifically about the robot arm’s safety modes: how many there are and their names.
- In the provided FACTS, the “Software Safety Restrictions” section repeatedly references the safety system being in “Normal” mode and “Reduced” mode (e.g., Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced options for safety planes; Tool Direction limit active in Normal, Reduced, or both).
- These references indicate the safety modes of the system are Normal and Reduced.
- Although the FACTS also include many unrelated details (programming, Run tab, Move commands, emergency events, operational modes like Manual/Automatic/Recovery/Backdrive), they still contain content directly addressing the safety modes in question.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True

The FACTS contain explicit references to the safety system modes “Normal” and “Reduced,” which directly relate to the question. Even though there is additional unrelated material, the presence of these keywords and semantics makes the FACTS relevant.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify where “modes” are defined in the FACTS. In 10.4 Software Safety Restrictions under “You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes,” the listed options are: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. These are per-plane configuration modes.

2) Note what the safety system modes are. The text refers to the safety system being in Normal or Reduced mode (e.g., “When the safety system is in Normal mode…”). Thus, “Normal” and “Reduced” are system states; “Disabled,” “Normal & Reduced,” and “Trigger Reduced Mode” are plane configuration options defining when a plane is active or how it behaves.

3) Compare with the student’s statement. The student claims the arm’s safety system has four named safety modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, and Normal & Reduced. This is inaccurate in two ways:
- Omission: The plane configuration also includes “Trigger Reduced Mode,” which the student leaves out.
- Mischaracterization: The student attributes these as “safety system” modes. The FACTS distinguish between safety system modes (Normal, Reduced) and safety plane configuration modes (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode).

4) Conclusion: Because the student both omits a listed mode and conflates plane configuration modes with the safety system’s modes, the answer is not fully grounded in the FACTS.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: the number of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student’s answer provides a specific count (“four”) and lists the names (“Disabled, Normal, Reduced, and Normal & Reduced”).
- The answer is concise and directly addresses the question without unrelated information.
- The brief parenthetical clarifies what “Normal & Reduced” means, which helps interpret the naming rather than distracting from the answer.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Explanation: The student clearly states the number of modes and names each one, in a concise and directly relevant manner that helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.

- The number of modes does not match (4 vs. 3).
- The student omits Recovery mode and introduces modes not listed in the ground truth (Disabled and “Normal & Reduced”).
- Therefore, the student’s answer conflicts with the ground truth in both count and names.

- The question asks what happens if the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.
- The facts also state that exceeding any safety limit constitutes a “Limit Violation,” and the safety system reaction to a limit violation is a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- Therefore, the facts directly contain the keywords and semantics needed to answer the question (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0).

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS state that Stopping Time Limit is a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated. Exceeding any configured safety limit is treated as a “Limit Violation.”
- The “Reactions of the safety system” table specifies that a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- The FACTS also define Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors.
- The student’s scenario (configured limit = 200 ms; actual stopping time = 1000 ms) clearly implies the stopping time exceeded the configured limit, i.e., a limit violation.
- The student concludes that this results in a Stop Category 0 and describes it as immediate removal of power to the arm, which matches the definition in the FACTS.
- The student does not introduce any unsupported claims; the numeric example is illustrative and consistent with the described mechanism.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided FACTS and contains no hallucinated information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) and reports an actual stop time (1000 ms).
- Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this constitutes a stopping time limit violation.
- Safety systems are designed to react to such violations by initiating a safety stop.
- The student specifies the reaction as a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal), which is a plausible and commonly defined response for a safety limit violation in many robot systems.

- The answer is concise and directly addresses what will happen: a limit violation leading to an immediate safety stop.
- It clearly helps answer the question by explaining the consequence of exceeding the limit.

Reasoning:
- The scenario describes exceeding the stopping time safety limit (200 ms limit vs. 1000 ms actual), which is a safety limit violation.
- The ground truth specifies that, upon such a violation, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Identify the student’s claims
- After maintenance or repair, safety checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and verify all safety functions.
- Checks must follow national/regional work safety regulations and the Service Manual (with Chapter 5 for trained-individual inspection plans).
- Specific precautions: power down/unplug Control Box, observe ESD, prevent water/dust ingress, check earth connection before re-powering, and verify safety functions after reassembly.
- Perform periodic inspections (flat rings, robot cable and connections, base/tool mounting bolts) according to the inspection plan and replace/rectify unacceptable parts.
- Parenthetical: includes “including modifications.”

2) Compare each claim to the provided FACTS
- Post-maintenance/repair safety checks and testing safety functions: Explicitly stated. “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Adherence to national/regional regulations and Service Manual/Chapter 5: Explicitly stated. The text requires compliance with safety instructions, local requirements, and the latest Service Manual; Chapter 5 is cited for inspection plans for trained individuals.
- Specific precautions (unplug main power, check earth, observe ESD, prevent water/dust): Explicitly listed under warnings.
- Periodic inspections of flat rings, robot cable/connections, base and tool mounting bolts with replacement/rectification if unacceptable: Explicitly covered in the Robot Arm Inspection Plan and associated instructions.
- Timeframes (monthly/biannual/annual): The inspection plan table includes these timeframes; the student’s general statement aligns with the table’s structure.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope content
- The parenthetical “including modifications” is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt. However, it does not introduce any new procedures or contradict the text; it simply broadens the context to modifications as a type of maintenance/repair activity. All actionable guidance the student lists remains directly supported by the FACTS.

2) Does the student answer address this? Yes. It explicitly says checks must be done after maintenance/repair/modifications to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
3) Is it concise and relevant? Mostly. The core statement is concise and on-point. However, part of the supporting points include pre-work precautions (powering down, ESD, ingress prevention) that are not strictly “afterwards,” which slightly reduces focus. The rest (verifying safety functions, following the service manual, and performing inspections) are directly relevant.

- The ground truth says: Yes, checks are required after a modification, and it lists specific safety-related tests (verify safety I/O connections, test all safety I/O, E-stops with brake engagement, safeguard inputs/reset, reduced mode indication, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, E-stop outputs behavior, and verifying external outputs; also determine commissioning requirements).
- The student answer says: Yes, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of all safety functions, and it references doing checks per regulations and the service manual. It also mentions general precautions (power down, ESD, ingress protection, earth connection) and performing inspections, and explicitly says to verify correct functioning of all safety functions after reassembly.

Assessment against criteria:
- Factually accurate relative to the ground truth: The student confirms that checks are needed and that safety functions must be verified, which aligns with the ground truth’s intent. Nothing contradicts the ground truth.
- No conflicting statements: None present.
- Completeness is not required by the rubric; while the student omits the specific individual tests (E-stop, enabling device, mode icon, outputs), their general statement to verify all safety functions is consistent with those specifics.

Reasoning:
- The student claims the arm’s safety system has three modes: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.
- In the provided facts, “Normal” and “Reduced” are indeed safety system modes. For example, safety planes and tool direction limits reference activation “when the safety system is in Normal mode” or “in Reduced mode.”
- “Disabled,” however, is not a safety system mode in the facts. “Disabled” refers to the state of a specific safety function (e.g., a safety plane or the tool direction limit) being turned off: “The safety plane is never active in this state” and “Disabled Tool direction limit — Never active.” This does not describe a global safety system mode.
- The facts also list additional plane configuration modes (“Normal & Reduced” and “Trigger Reduced Mode”), which the student omitted. While completeness wasn’t required, asserting “three modes” and labeling “Disabled” as a safety system mode conflicts with the source.

Conclusion: The facts contain clear, directly relevant guidance about checks to perform after modifying the robot arm.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s claims:
- After maintenance, repair (and modification), checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of all safety functions.
- Maintenance/inspection/calibration/repair must follow the Service Manual; repairs by UR or trained designated individuals per the Service Manual.
- After work, verify safety functions and follow national/regional work safety regulations.
- When disassembling robot arm or Control Box: unplug main power and prevent re-energization, check earth connection before re-powering, observe ESD precautions, prevent water/dust ingress, and be aware that high voltage can remain for hours in the Control Box power supply.

2) Map claims to the provided FACTS:
- “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested. Checks must adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations.” This directly supports the student’s main claim about post-work safety checks and regulations.
- “Conduct all maintenance, inspection, calibration and repair work according to the latest version of Service Manual… Repair work should only be done by Universal Robots. Client designated, trained individuals can do repair work, provided they follow the Service Manual.” This supports the Service Manual and qualified personnel statements.
- Warnings under Maintenance: unplug main power, prevent others from powering on, check earth connection before re-powering, observe ESD, prevent water/dust. “WARNING: ELECTRICITY… high voltages (up to 600 V) can be present… for several hours after the Control Box has been switched off.” These match the student’s safety procedure details.

3) Check for information outside scope (“hallucinations”):
- The student adds “or modification” to “maintenance and repair.” While “modification” is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the rest of the content is directly grounded in the FACTS. This addition does not contradict the manual’s guidance and is a reasonable extension, but it is not explicitly stated in the excerpt.

- The supporting details about following the Service Manual and verifying safety functions further reinforce the answer and help the user understand what to check and who should perform it.
- Some additional points (unplugging power, ESD, residual voltage) are more about safe maintenance procedures rather than post-modification checks. While slightly beyond the narrow scope, they are still related to the maintenance context and do not detract from the relevance.
- Overall, the answer is clear, actionable, and sufficiently concise for the question asked.

- The question asks about the robot’s safety modes and their names.
- The provided facts explicitly discuss safety-related modes multiple times:
  - Safety Planes “Modes” section lists Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode, and Disabled, and explains how they behave when the safety system is in Normal or Reduced mode.
  - Tool Direction restriction also uses the same safety mode states (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced).
- The facts also describe operational modes (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, Backdrive). While these are operational rather than “safety modes,” they are still closely related to system modes and reference reduced speed and safety plane usage, reinforcing relevance to the concept of modes in a safety context.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True
The facts contain direct references to safety modes (Normal and Reduced) and related mode states used in safety features, thus they are relevant to the question.","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Safety-plane modes
- Facts list five configurable safety-plane modes: Disabled; Normal; Reduced; Normal & Reduced; Trigger Reduced Mode.
- The student lists exactly these five. This matches the facts.

2) Operational/safety-related modes
- Facts list operational modes: Automatic, Manual, and High Speed Manual Mode. They also describe Recovery Mode (a type of Manual Mode) and Backdrive (a Manual Mode used to force joints).
- The student identifies the same set and characterizes Recovery Mode and Backdrive consistently with the facts.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope claims
- The student does not introduce additional modes or behaviors not present in the facts.
- The brief bracketed citations are references and do not assert new technical content beyond the provided facts.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is fully consistent with the provided facts and contains no hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for the number of safety modes the arm has and the names of each.
- The student anticipates ambiguity and provides two interpretations:
  - Safety-plane (configurable safety) modes: lists a count (five) and names each mode.
  - Operational/safety-related robot modes: lists main modes and related states, with names.
- This directly addresses “how many” and “what are the names” in both plausible senses of “safety modes.”
- The response is concise and focused on the requested information, without unnecessary digression.
- Even if the second list mixes “operational” with “safety-related,” the student clearly labels the distinction, which helps answer the question given potential ambiguity.

- The ground truth states the arm has three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- The student lists two different sets:

- The question asks about a safety Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) and an actual stop that takes longer (1000 ms), and what happens in that case.
- The provided facts include a dedicated section on Safety Functions, explicitly listing “Stopping Time Limit” and explaining that these functions “dynamically reduce the speed of the robot motion such that it can always be stopped within the limits.”
- The facts also state the safety system reactions: for a “Limit Violation,” the reaction is “Stop Category 0.” This directly addresses what happens when a safety limit (such as stopping time) is exceeded.
- Additional corroborating details appear in the Recovery section and in the summary note that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, safety outputs reset to low.

Conclusion:
- The facts contain the exact safety function (Stopping Time Limit) and the defined reaction to exceeding it (Stop Category 0). Therefore, they are directly relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Does a Stopping Time Limit violation trigger a Stop Category 0?
- The facts state that any “Limit Violation” triggers Stop Category 0 (10.2.2 Safety Functions, Trigger/Reaction table). Exceeding the Stopping Time Limit is a safety limit violation, so treating it as a Limit Violation with Stop Category 0 is correct.

2) Is the description of Stop Category 0 accurate?
- The facts define Stop Category 0 as a “hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors” (PROFIsafe status message definitions). The student’s description matches this.

3) Do safety outputs reset low on violation/fault?
- The facts state: “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low” (10.2.2). The student states this correctly.

4) Must the safety system be restarted and are programs blocked until recovery is done?
- The facts state: “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.” Also, when Recovery is activated, “You cannot run programs… but the robot arm can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope” (Safety Parameter Set – Recovery). The student’s statements align with this.

Conclusion
- The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided facts and does not introduce information outside the scope.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured stopping time safety limit (200 ms). So we’re looking for the system’s response to a limit violation.
- The student explicitly identifies this as a Stopping Time Limit violation and states the consequence: a safety stop (Stop Category 0).
- They add brief, relevant consequences of that stop: power removal, safety outputs go low, restart required, and how to recover. These details directly describe what “will happen” after the violation.
- The answer stays focused on the safety reaction and recovery; it doesn’t wander into unrelated topics. While it includes a couple of extra details, they are still pertinent.

- They list specific safety precautions for power isolation (power down via Teach Pendant, unplug mains, wait ~30 seconds, unplug main power at Control Box), and to observe ESD, prevent water/dust ingress, and check earth/ground before re-powering.
- They outline a robot arm inspection plan (ZERO position if possible, disconnect power, inspect cable, check base and tool flange bolts, inspect/replace flat rings, contact distributor if damaged within warranty).
- They describe functional verification steps (unmount tools or set TCP/payload/CoG, Freedrive procedure using the 3PE button, hold a horizontally elongated pose without support, periodic testing of stopping performance to detect degradation).

2) Check alignment with provided facts
- Post-maintenance checks and testing safety functions: Matches “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Power isolation and safety precautions: All listed points are present in the facts: pressing the power button, unplugging the mains, waiting ~30 seconds, unplugging the main power cable at the Control Box, observing ESD, preventing water/dust entry, and checking earth connection.
- Robot Arm Inspection Plan: Steps match the listed inspection plan (ZERO position, power off/disconnect, cable inspection, tightening base and tool flange bolts, inspecting/replacing flat rings, and contacting the distributor if damage is found within warranty).
- Functional verification: Unmount tools or set TCP/payload/CoG as specified; Freedrive activation via 3PE button press sequence; verifying the arm maintains a horizontally elongated position without support and without Freedrive; periodic testing of stopping performance is explicitly described in the facts.
- The student did not contradict the exception noted in the facts that if stop time/distance safety functions are used as the basis of risk reduction, no monitoring/testing is required; they simply omitted this nuance, which does not introduce error.

- The FACTS also reference the safety system being in either Normal or Reduced mode (e.g., “When the safety system is in Normal mode…” and “When the safety system is in Reduced mode…”), which supports the idea of two primary safety system modes.
- The student’s statement that there are “two primary modes: Normal and Reduced” is consistent with the FACTS.
- The student’s list of safety plane configurations exactly matches the options given in the FACTS, and the explanation of Trigger Reduced Mode aligns with the provided description (“when crossed” vs. “positioned beyond it” is equivalent).

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student’s main claim is that a safety limit violation will initiate a Stop Category 0. This matches the provided facts: under “Safety Functions,” a “Limit Violation” triggers “Stop Category 0,” and “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.”
- The student cites the Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety limit and implies that exceeding it constitutes a limit violation. That is consistent with the document: Stopping Time Limit is a safety function, and exceeding any configured safety limit is a limit violation that triggers Stop Category 0.
- The student says that when a safety limit is exceeded, all safety outputs reset to low. This is explicitly supported by the notice stating that any fault or violation resets all safety outputs to low.
- The student states that Recovery is activated and you cannot run programs until the safety system is restarted, and that the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. The manual’s Recovery section supports that Recovery mode prevents program execution and allows manual movement to get back within limits. The text explicitly gives Recovery activation as an example when limits are exceeded at startup (e.g., joint position outside a limit). While the student phrases Recovery activation as general, it is still within the scope of the provided information and not introducing external facts.

Minor nuance:
- The manual presents Recovery activation explicitly in the startup/out-of-limits example; it does not state that Recovery is always activated for every limit violation. The student’s unconditional phrasing slightly overgeneralizes, but it remains grounded in the document and does not introduce information outside the scope.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and states the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this exceeds the configured limit, so it is a safety limit violation.
- The student states it is a safety limit violation and that the safety system will initiate a stop (they specify Stop Category 0) and then provides relevant consequences: safety outputs go low and Recovery is required before operation can resume. These points directly address “what will happen.”
- The answer is concise: one clear sentence answering the question, followed by brief, on-topic supporting points. All content is relevant to the behavior when the stopping time limit is exceeded.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time actual (1000 ms) exceeds the safety limit (200 ms), so a safety limit violation occurs.
- The ground truth states that when this happens, the robot enters recovery mode.
- The student states it is a safety limit violation and adds that Recovery is activated. This matches the ground truth outcome.

- The question asks what checks are needed after a modification to the robot arm. This implies post-maintenance/repair verification and safety validation.
- The facts include a “Maintenance and Repair” section that explicitly states: after maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level, adhering to regulations, and the correct functioning of all safety functions must be tested. This directly addresses the question.
- The facts also include “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance,” which discusses testing stop performance and when continuous monitoring might suffice—relevant to post-modification verification.
- The “Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection” and “Inspection Plan” provide concrete post-maintenance inspection steps (e.g., checking cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings, and a Freedrive hold-position check), which are applicable after making a modification.
- While many other sections (e.g., Program/Installation Manager, Cybersecurity, Assembly, various connection details) are not directly needed to answer the question, the presence of unrelated material is acceptable per the grading criteria as long as some facts are related.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

- Main claim: The student says post-maintenance checks must verify the correct functioning of all safety functions to ensure the required safety level. This is directly supported: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level. The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.” The student’s “as required by local/regional safety regulations” also matches the text’s requirement to adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations.

- Safety/power procedures before re-powering: The student lists powering down via the Teach Pendant power button, unplugging the mains/power cable from the Control Box, allowing ~30 seconds for discharge, checking earth connection, observing ESD precautions, and preventing water/dust ingress. All of these appear in the provided material: power-down sequence with a 30-second discharge, checking the earth connection before re-powering, ESD regulations, and preventing water/dust ingress.

- Robot Arm Inspection Plan: The student cites moving to ZERO if possible, turning off and disconnecting Control Box power, inspecting the robot cable and its connection, checking base mounting bolts and tool flange bolts, and inspecting/replacing flat rings. These steps are explicitly listed in the Robot Arm Inspection Plan.

- Testing stopping performance: The student states to test periodically for degraded stopping times and notes continuous monitoring by the robot when stop time/distance safety functions are the basis of risk reduction. This matches the text: periodic testing is advised unless those specific safety functions are used, in which case no monitoring/testing is required because the robot does continuous monitoring.

- Hallucinations check: The student does not introduce procedures or specifications not present in the facts. All details (including the 30-second discharge, ESD/water/dust cautions, inspection items, and stopping performance notes) are within the provided content.

Conclusion

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the intent of the question: The user wants to know if checks are required after modifying a robot arm, and if so, what checks.
2) Check if the student directly answers this: The student clearly says “Yes” and specifies performing post‑maintenance checks and verifying safety functions. This directly addresses the question.
3) Evaluate helpfulness: The student provides specific follow-up checks (power/safety procedures before re‑powering, inspection plan items, and testing stopping performance and safety functions). These are actionable and pertinent to post‑modification verification.
4) Assess conciseness and relevance: The answer is reasonably concise and focused on post‑modification checks. The listed items are directly related; no off-topic material is included. The level of detail supports the question without being unnecessarily long.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that after a robot arm modification, tests are required, specifically verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing emergency stops, safeguard inputs, mode/reduced-mode indicators, enabling device, relevant outputs, and commissioning requirements.
- The student explicitly confirms that checks are needed and emphasizes verifying all safety functions and stopping performance. This aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on safety function testing (e-stop, safeguard, reduced mode, etc.).
- The student adds extra procedures (power-down, inspection plan, mechanical checks). These do not conflict with the ground truth and are consistent with prudent practice after modifications.
- While the student does not enumerate each specific test (e.g., mode icon change, enabling device), omission is acceptable under the rubric as long as there is no contradiction and the content is factually accurate relative to the ground truth.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is consistent with the ground truth, contains no conflicting statements, and is factually accurate.

- The question asks specifically about “safety modes” of the arm and their names.
- The provided facts include multiple sections that directly reference safety system modes:
  - Safety planes “Modes” explicitly list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode, with explanations tied to when the safety system is in Normal or Reduced mode.
  - Tool Direction Restriction also lists modes in terms of safety system states: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
  - Recovery Mode is described as a safety-related manual mode triggered when a safety limit is exceeded.
- These references contain the exact keywords “safety,” “mode,” “Normal mode,” and “Reduced mode,” and enumerate named modes relevant to the question.
- Although the facts also include unrelated content (programming, run tab, program nodes, technical specs), criterion (3) allows some unrelated information as long as relevant content is present.

Conclusion: The facts contain clear, direct information about safety modes and their names.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student lists the following modes: Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, High Speed Manual Mode, and mentions a reduced-speed behavior when a Three-Position Enabling Device (3PE) is configured.
- Cross-check with the provided FACTS:
  - Modes section (13.3) explicitly defines Automatic Mode and Manual Mode.
  - It also defines High Speed Manual Mode as available in Manual Mode when a 3PE is configured.
  - Recovery Mode is described in 13.3.1 and is a type of Manual Mode.
  - The reduced-speed behavior with a 3PE is stated: “If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual Reduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.”
  - The student references “Safety Plane sections” and “safety modes.” The Safety Planes section (10.4) does define plane Modes (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode). Although the student doesn’t list these, merely noting that safety modes are described there is consistent with the facts.
- No claims contradict the facts, and no content is introduced that lies outside the provided material.
- Minor note: calling Automatic/Manual “safety modes” is slightly imprecise (they are operational modes), but the student also correctly ties reduced speed to 3PE handling and mentions Recovery Mode, which is safety-related. This imprecision does not constitute hallucination or contradiction.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- Rationale: Every mode the student named and the reduced-speed behavior are present in the FACTS, and no information outside the provided scope was introduced.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for a specific count (“How many”) and the exact names of the safety modes.
- The student says “several safety modes” without giving a definite number, so the question’s first requirement (how many) is not answered.
- The names provided (Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, Recovery Mode) appear to be operating modes, not explicitly “safety modes.” The mentions of “High Speed Manual Mode” and “Reduced speed variation” are described as options/variations, not clearly identified as safety modes.
- The answer includes extra contextual information rather than a clear, concise list that directly matches the question’s request.

Conclusion: The response does not provide a clear count and does not definitively list the safety modes by name, so it does not directly or sufficiently answer the question.

Relevance: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are exactly three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- The student claims “several” safety modes and lists Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, and Recovery Mode, plus mentions High Speed Manual Mode and a Reduced speed variation.
- Only Recovery Mode aligns with the ground truth.
- Automatic Mode does not match Normal mode, and Manual Mode does not match Reduced mode.
- The student’s count (“several”) and the named modes do not match the specified three modes and their names in the ground truth.

- If a safety limit is exceeded (e.g., stopping time limit) and the robot cannot stop within the configured limit, a Stop Category 0 is triggered.

1) Identify the topic of the question: It asks about the consequence when the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds a configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms).
2) Check the provided facts for related keywords/semantics: The facts explicitly cover “Stopping Time Limit” under Safety Functions (10.2.1) and describe that it “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” They also explain the safety system reactions (10.2.2), stating that a “Limit Violation” triggers “Stop Category 0,” and that if any fault/violation is detected, “all safety outputs reset to low.”
3) Map to the question: Exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit is precisely a limit violation. The facts state the resulting reaction (Stop Category 0), which directly answers “what will happen.”

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the relevant facts
- The manual states that if a safety limit is exceeded or a fault is detected, the reaction is Stop Category 0 (10.2.2: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and “Fault Detection -> Stop Category 0”).
- For stopping performance, the Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit functions are designed to dynamically reduce speed so the robot can be stopped within the configured limits; if those limits are violated, that is a limit violation (10.2.1, 10.2.2).
- The safety system monitors these conditions; for reduced mode, it explicitly states that if reduced limits continue to be violated, a Stop Category 0 is triggered, and the robot guarantees entry into reduced limits within 0.5 s (8.2.1), reinforcing continuous monitoring behavior.

2) Compare the student’s statements to the facts
- “If a safety limit is exceeded (e.g., stopping time limit)… a Stop Category 0 is triggered.” This aligns directly with “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0.”
- “The safety system continuously monitors and will Stop Category 0 when the limit is violated.” This is consistent with the described monitoring and Cat 0 on violation.
- The numerical example (limit 200 ms, actual 1000 ms) is presented as a hypothetical illustration, not as a claimed default or specification, and it correctly describes a violation leading to Cat 0.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope claims
- The student does not introduce unsupported features or behaviors. The example numbers are hypothetical and do not contradict the documentation.
- No claims are made that conflict with the fact that the system also proactively reduces speed to remain within limits.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer is consistent with the provided facts and does not include hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the configured stopping time safety limit (200 ms) is exceeded because the robot actually stops in 1000 ms.
- The student states that exceeding the stopping time limit will trigger a Stop Category 0 and explains that the safety system monitors and triggers this when limits are violated.
- This directly addresses the scenario: the robot exceeded the configured time, so a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- The answer is concise, stays on topic, and provides a clear outcome that helps answer the question. The added reference supports the claim without adding unnecessary length.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The ground truth states that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode.
- The student asserts that exceeding the limit triggers a Stop Category 0, without mentioning recovery mode.
- While a safety stop could be part of the overall response, the required outcome per the ground truth is explicitly “enter recovery mode.” The student’s answer does not state this and instead provides a different specific behavior (Stop Category 0).

Conclusion: The student’s answer does not match the expected outcome (“enter recovery mode”) and is therefore incorrect relative to the ground truth.

- 15.1 Testing Stopping Performance advises periodic testing of stopping performance, which is relevant as a post-modification validation to ensure safety hasn’t degraded.
- Robot Arm Inspection Plan outlines concrete checks (cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings, and a freedrive positional hold check) that are appropriate after work on the arm.
3) While other sections (e.g., cybersecurity, program manager) are not directly about post-modification checks, the presence of the above directly relevant items meets the relevance criterion.

- Test the correct functioning of all safety functions.
- Ensure checks comply with applicable safety regulations.
- Follow the Service Manual guidance for inspection and safety verification.
- Check safety functions after any fault or modification.

2) Compare with the provided FACTS:
- The FACTS explicitly state: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level,” and “The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.” This supports the student’s first two claims.
- The FACTS also state checks must adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations and that maintenance/inspection/repair should follow the latest Service Manual. This supports the student’s points about compliance with regulations and following the Service Manual.
- The FACTS say repair work includes troubleshooting in addition to the actual repair itself, which covers “after a fault” implicitly.

3) Check for information outside the scope:
- The student adds “after any fault or modification.” While “fault” is supported (via repair/troubleshooting), “modification” is not mentioned in the provided FACTS. This is an extrapolation beyond the text.

- Identify claims in the student answer:
  1) “The arm has three primary safety modes: Automatic, Manual, and Recovery Mode.”
  2) “Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode used when a safety limit is exceeded; it moves the arm back within limits and does not allow running programs.”

- Check against the provided facts:
  • Modes: The manual explicitly describes Automatic Mode and Manual Mode (13.3. Modes). It also describes Recovery Mode and states it “is a type of Manual Mode” (13.3.1. Recovery Mode). Thus, listing Automatic, Manual, and Recovery Mode is consistent with the facts, though the manual also mentions High Speed Manual Mode and Backdrive as additional Manual-related modes. The student’s phrasing “three primary safety modes” is not terminology used in the manual, but it does not assert something contradictory; it simply groups these three modes.
  • Recovery Mode details: The manual states that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, it is a type of Manual Mode, it is used to move the robot back within limits, and “You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active” (13.3.1). This exactly matches the student’s description.

- Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope info:
  • No technical details are invented. The bracketed citation does not introduce new content beyond the facts.
  • Minor terminology nuance: the manual doesn’t label these as “primary safety modes,” and there are other modes/features (High Speed Manual Mode, Backdrive), but the student did not deny their existence. This is a wording nuance rather than a factual error.

- The student lists three modes: Automatic, Manual, and Recovery. While the count (three) matches, two of the names (Automatic and Manual) do not match Normal and Reduced, so the set of modes is incorrect relative to the ground truth.
- The additional detail about Recovery Mode being a type of Manual Mode and its behavior is extra information not in the ground truth; however, the primary issue is the incorrect naming of the modes.",resp_0c5ddd89a210c6b00068f67343a7bc81a2b570e0710e590fad,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,completed,1760981827.0,12401,72,12473

A recovery is required before normal operation can resume. So with a Stopping Time Limit of 200 ms but a stop taking 1000 ms, the robot will trigger a Stop Category 0 and require recovery before a program can run again.

- The question asks about the outcome when the Stopping Time Limit (a safety function) is set to 200 ms but the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. So we need facts about:
  • What the Stopping Time Limit safety function is, and
  • What happens when a safety limit is violated.
- The provided facts explicitly cover “Stopping Time Limit” as a configurable safety function and explain its purpose.
- They also state the safety system’s reactions, including that a “Limit Violation” or “if a safety limit is exceeded” triggers a Stop Category 0.
- Therefore, the facts contain the exact keywords and semantics relevant to the question: Stopping Time Limit, exceeding safety limits, and the resulting stop category.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Does exceeding a safety limit trigger a Stop Category 0?
- Yes. The manual states that a “Limit Violation” and any “fault or violation” in the safety system initiates a Stop Category 0. This applies to any safety limit, including Stopping Time Limit.

2) What happens after a safety limit violation?
- The manual states: “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.” It then describes Recovery as the mechanism that is activated (example given for joint position out of limits) and notes that you cannot run programs while Recovery is active and must move the robot back within limits.

3) Does the student’s concrete example (Stopping Time Limit = 200 ms, actual stop = 1000 ms) fit?
- As a hypothetical, it represents a limit violation, which would trigger a Stop Category 0 and require a safety restart. The student’s conclusion that recovery is required before running a program again aligns with the manual’s description that after a limit violation, Recovery can be activated and programs cannot run until the issue is resolved.

4) Any overreach or contradiction?
- The student stays within scope. A minor nuance is that the manual also notes Stopping Time/Distance Limits dynamically reduce speed to keep the robot within limits; however, if a violation still occurs, the Stop Category 0 behavior and need to restart/recover remain correct.

Conclusion: The answer is grounded in the provided facts and does not introduce information beyond them.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the measured stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- A correct, relevant answer should state that exceeding the safety limit triggers a safety stop/fault and requires recovery/reset before resuming operation.
- The student answer explicitly states that exceeding the stopping time limit triggers a Stop Category 0 and requires recovery before normal operation can resume, and applies that to the given numbers (200 ms limit vs. 1000 ms actual).
- The answer is concise, directly addresses the scenario, and describes the outcome clearly without unnecessary detail.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that if the stopping time safety limit is violated, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- In the scenario, the stopping time limit is 200 ms and the actual stop took 1000 ms, which exceeds the limit.
- The student states that exceeding a safety limit triggers a Stop Category 0 and requires recovery before normal operation resumes.
- This aligns with the ground truth’s outcome: a safety violation leading to a required recovery. The added detail about Stop Category 0 does not conflict with the ground truth.

- The question asks what checks are needed after a modification to the robot arm. This aligns with maintenance/repair follow-up procedures and safety verification.
- The provided facts include a dedicated Maintenance and Repair section stating: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level. The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.” This directly answers the question.
- The Testing Stopping Performance section is relevant because it discusses verifying stop times/distances and how degraded stopping performance may require changes—appropriate after a modification that could affect motion/braking.
- The Robot Arm Inspection Plan provides concrete checks (cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings, and a Freedrive hold test) that are applicable post-modification.
- Other sections (Log Tab) can support post-change verification by reviewing joint status/temperatures and errors; still tangentially relevant.
- While many sections (Program/Installation Manager, Cybersecurity, Passwords, Assembly dimensioning, etc.) are not directly about post-modification checks, the criteria say the facts are relevant if any part addresses the question.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Compare key claims in the Student Answer to the FACTS
- “After maintenance or modifications, you must perform checks to ensure the required safety level and correct functioning of all safety functions.” 
  - Matches Safety for Maintenance: after maintenance and repair work, checks must ensure the required safety level and all safety functions must be tested. Grounded.

- “Conduct checks in accordance with the Safety for Maintenance guidance and test the correct functioning of all safety functions.”
  - Directly supported by Safety for Maintenance. Grounded.

- “Ensure you unplug power and observe proper electrical safety practices during any inspection or repair, including verifying earth/ground connections before re-powering.”
  - Matches the Warning section: unplug main power, power off other energy sources, prevent re-energization, and check earth connection before re-powering; also electricity warning about hazards. Grounded.

- “If you performed work on the robot arm or Control Box, follow the Warning and inspection plan to confirm continued safe operation, including the Robot Arm Inspection Plan details.”
  - Supported by the Robot Arm Inspection Plan and the general requirement to perform checks after maintenance/repair. Grounded.

2) Check for hallucinations or content outside scope
- The use of “modifications” is a slight extension beyond the exact terms “maintenance and repair,” but it does not introduce contradictory or unsupported procedures and remains consistent with the intent of post-work safety checks. No specific, unsupported procedures are introduced.
- All other references (warnings, grounding, inspection plan) are explicitly present in the FACTS.
- No additional tools, steps, or policies not present in the FACTS are claimed.

3) Completeness vs. necessity
- The Student Answer does not need to list every warning (e.g., ESD, water/dust) to remain grounded. What is included is accurate and within scope.

Conclusion

Grounded: True

The Student Answer accurately reflects the documented safety checks after maintenance/repair, electrical safety practices, and reference to the inspection plan without introducing unsupported or contradictory information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after modifying the robot arm.
- The student explicitly answers yes and specifies the type of checks: verifying safety level and correct functioning of all safety functions, following safety instructions.
- They provide concrete actions: perform checks per Safety for Maintenance guidance, test all safety functions, ensure proper electrical safety (power unplugged, ground verification), and follow the inspection plan for the robot arm/control box.
- The content is concise, uses brief bullet points, and stays on topic. The electrical safety note is relevant to post-maintenance checks before re-powering.
- The guidance directly helps the user know what to do after a modification.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that after a modification to the robot arm, there is a list of safety-related tests to perform (e.g., verifying safety I/O, testing emergency stops and brakes, safeguard inputs and resets, reduced mode indications, operational mode icon changes, enabling device behavior, and checking outputs like Robot Moving/Reduced Mode, plus commissioning requirements).
- The student answer affirms that checks are required after maintenance/modifications and explicitly mentions testing the correct functioning of all safety functions and following maintenance/inspection plans. This aligns with the intent of the ground truth.
- The student’s added points about unplugging power and observing electrical safety during inspection/repair are general safety practices and do not conflict with the ground truth. They are framed as pre-power checks, not as substitutes for the powered functional tests.
- While the student does not enumerate each specific test from the ground truth, nothing they state contradicts the required checks; their statements are broadly consistent.

2) Scan the provided facts for safety modes:
- In “10.4. Software Safety Restrictions” under Safety Planes “Modes,” there is a clear list of mode names tied to safety functionality: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode. These are explicitly safety-related and include the names of modes.
- Additional “modes” appear elsewhere (e.g., “13.3. Modes” lists Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, and Recovery Mode). While these are operational modes rather than strictly “safety modes,” they are semantically related to modes that affect safe operation and include a “Recovery Mode” section with safety limits. This still contains relevant keywords (“mode,” “safety,” “limits”) and is contextually related.
- Other sections (e.g., Tool Direction restriction with Normal/Reduced/Normal & Reduced states; Recovery Mode safety limits) also intersect with safety concepts and modes.

3) Conclusion: Because the facts include explicit safety plane modes and other mode-related safety content, they contain the necessary keywords and semantics to be relevant to the question.

- The provided facts include multiple directly relevant points:
  - Stopping Time Limit is a configurable safety function intended to ensure the robot can always be stopped within the set limit; it dynamically reduces speed to meet the limit.
  - The safety system reactions state that a Limit Violation results in a Stop Category 0.
  - Additional notes specify that if any safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and safety outputs reset to low.

- The facts also provide the safety system reactions table stating that a “Limit Violation” triggers a “Stop Category 0.” Multiple notices reinforce that if the safety system detects a fault or violation, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and safety outputs reset low. Recovery behavior after a safety limit violation is also described.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the exact scenario posed in the question (exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit) and the consequent system action.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s claims: The student answer is empty, so there are no claims, explanations, or references to evaluate.
2) Compare to the provided FACTS: Because no statements are made, there is no evidence that the student used or aligned with the provided facts (e.g., PLd Cat. 3 architecture, safety functions like Speed Limit, Force Limit, stop categories, safety I/O behavior, Reduced mode semantics, PROFIsafe, etc.).
3) Check for hallucinations: With no content, there are no hallucinated details.
4) Evaluate against the criteria: To be “grounded,” the answer must be based on the provided facts and avoid hallucinations. While it avoids hallucinations by omission, it fails to demonstrate grounding in the facts because it provides no factual content at all.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question asks about the consequence when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the safety limit (200 ms).
2. A relevant answer should state that exceeding the safety limit would trigger a safety response (e.g., a fault/alarm and safe stop/emergency stop).
3. The student provided no answer, so it does not address the scenario or its consequence.

- The provided facts explicitly define the Stopping Time Limit safety function and explain that safety limit violations trigger specific stop categories.
- Relevant excerpts include:
  - Stopping Time Limit is a configurable safety function intended to cap stopping time.
  - “The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded… Reaction: Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
  - “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system… a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- Therefore, the facts directly address the scenario posed by the question.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated, and they state that if any safety limit is violated, the safety system reaction is a Stop Category 0. Therefore, exceeding the configured Stopping Time Limit constitutes a “Limit Violation” that triggers Stop Category 0.
- The student’s conclusion that exceeding the configured Stopping Time Limit (their example: actual 1000 ms vs limit 200 ms) results in a Stop Category 0 is directly aligned with “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” in the FACTS.
- The student’s note that recovery may be required is consistent with the FACTS’ Recovery section, which explains that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted and Recovery can be activated to manually move back within limits (with defined recovery limits). The student’s phrasing “may be required” is cautious and does not overstate beyond the FACTS.
- No unsupported mechanisms or contradictory stop categories were introduced. The added bracketed citation does not introduce new technical claims outside the provided FACTS.","Step-by-step reasoning:

3) Compare to the student’s answer: The student states that exceeding the limit triggers a Stop Category 0 and briefly notes recovery may be required.
4) Check concision and relevance: The response is succinct, directly addresses the scenario, and clearly states what will happen.

- The student’s answer is concise and directly addresses what happens when the stopping time exceeds the limit.
- It helps answer the question by stating the specific outcome (Stop Category 0).

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ground truth asserts a definite outcome: because the stopping time limit (200 ms) was violated (actual 1000 ms), the robot arm will enter recovery mode.

- Compare with the provided FACTS:
  • 13.3 Modes explicitly defines Automatic Mode and Manual Mode. It also describes High Speed Manual Mode as a hold-to-run function available in Manual Mode when a 3PE device is configured. This supports claim (3) and that High Speed Manual is a variation of Manual.
  • 13.3.1 Recovery Mode is explicitly named and described as “a type of Manual Mode,” automatically activated when a safety limit is exceeded, and programs cannot run during it. This supports claim (1) insofar as Recovery is indeed a named mode, though it is a subtype of Manual; the student acknowledges it as a mode, which is consistent with the text.
  • The table under 13.3 includes a “Reduced speed**” row, with a footnote that in Manual Mode the robot operates at Manual Reduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.

- They state that a Limit Violation results in a Stop Category 0 and that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.
- These points directly answer the question’s scenario (exceeding the stopping time limit).

Relevance: True","Grounded: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student claims that exceeding a Stopping Time Limit triggers a Stop Category 0. This is supported by the facts: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and “if a safety limit is exceeded, then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- However, the student’s use of specific values (“1000 ms > 200 ms”) is not supported by the provided facts. The facts do not state a 200 ms stopping time limit value, nor do they provide any specific numeric stopping time limit for comparison. The only related timings given are an accuracy figure for Stopping Time Limit (50 ms) and a possible 500 ms delay when switching between Normal/Reduced configurations—neither establishes a 200 ms limit.
- Therefore, while the general conclusion about the Stop Category 0 on limit violation is correct, the inclusion of the 1000 ms and 200 ms figures introduces information outside the provided facts.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured stopping time safety limit (200 ms).
- In safety systems, exceeding the monitored stopping time typically triggers a safety violation that escalates to an immediate safe stop (often implemented via STO), corresponding to a Stop Category 0.
- Therefore, the expected outcome is that the safety system intervenes and initiates a Category 0 stop (and usually a safety fault requiring reset).

Evaluation of the student answer:
- The student correctly identifies that because 1000 ms > 200 ms, the safety system will initiate a Stop Category 0.
- The answer is concise and directly addresses what will happen in this scenario.
- While it could mention a resulting safety fault/reset requirement, it still clearly conveys the main consequence.

- The question asks about what happens when the Stopping Time Limit (configured to 200 ms) is exceeded (actual stop took 1000 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and state that it “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The facts also describe the safety system’s reactions: a “Limit Violation” triggers a “Stop Category 0,” and note that if any fault/violation is detected, all safety outputs reset to low.
- These points directly address the scenario in the question (exceeding the configured stopping time), so they are semantically and keyword relevant.
- While many additional sections (e.g., MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, general I/O setup) are not needed to answer the question, the grading criteria say facts are relevant if they contain any keywords/semantic meaning related to the question, which they do.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

- The student states that a violation of the Stopping Time Limit triggers a Stop Category 0. In the provided facts (10.2.2 Safety Functions), any “Limit Violation” results in a Stop Category 0. The Stopping Time Limit is one of the configurable safety limits, so exceeding it is a limit violation. This aligns with the facts.

- The student’s recovery steps match the “Recovery” section: when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted; programs cannot run during recovery; and the arm can be brought back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope. These points are explicitly stated in the facts.

- The student does not introduce information outside the provided material. Phrases like “stops to a safety halt” are consistent with the concept of a safety stop and do not contradict the facts.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and states the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this is a clear safety limit violation.
- In most robot safety systems, exceeding a configured stopping-time limit triggers a safety stop/fault condition.
- The student’s answer states that a safety stop will be triggered (they specify Stop Category 0) and outlines the need to perform a safety recovery before resuming, which aligns with typical behavior after a safety violation.
- While specifying “Stop Category 0” may be more specific than the question requires and could vary by implementation, the core outcome (a safety stop due to violation) is correct and directly addresses “what will happen.”
- The recovery steps are relevant follow-up information and remain concise.

1) What the question asks: After making a modification to the robot arm, the user wants to know if any checks are required afterward.

2) Relevant content in the provided facts:
- “Safety for Maintenance” explicitly states that after maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that the correct functioning of all safety functions shall be tested.
- “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance” discusses testing to determine if stopping performance is degraded, which can be pertinent after changes affecting motion or stopping.
- “Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection” includes an inspection plan and specific checks (disconnect power, inspect cables, check base mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, inspect flat rings) and a Freedrive positional hold check—directly applicable post-modification.
- Warnings about power and ESD handling are also relevant to post-maintenance/repair procedures.

- Safety for Maintenance: The student correctly lists unplugging the main power from the Control Box, isolating other energy sources, checking the earth connection before re-powering, observing ESD precautions, and preventing water/dust ingress. All of these match the warnings and instructions in the Maintenance and Repair section.

- Stopping performance: The student states to test periodically for degraded stopping performance and notes that if stop time/distance safety functions are the basis of risk reduction, no additional monitoring is required because the robot continuously monitors. This aligns with the Testing Stopping Performance subsection.

- Robot Arm Inspection Plan: The student includes moving to ZERO position (if possible), powering off and disconnecting, inspecting the cable between Control Box and robot arm, checking base and tool flange bolts, inspecting flat rings and replacing if worn, avoiding compressed air, and contacting the distributor if damage is observed within warranty. These points are directly reflected in the inspection plan and associated notices.

1) Identify the core of the QUESTION: It asks about the “stopping time safety limit” (set to 200 ms) and what happens if the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. So key concepts are “Stopping Time Limit,” exceeding that limit, and the system’s reaction.

2) Look for matching concepts in the FACTS:
- The FACTS define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- They also state that the safety system monitors safety limits and under “Limit Violation” the reaction is “Stop Category 0.”
- The FACTS further note that safety functions (including Stopping Time/Distance limits) dynamically reduce speed to keep stops within limits.

3) Determine relevance: These points directly address what a stopping time limit is and what happens when it’s exceeded (limit violation → Stop Category 0). They contain the exact keywords and semantic content needed to answer the question.

Conclusion:

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The facts define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” If the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit, that constitutes a safety limit violation.
- The safety reactions table states that a “Limit Violation” triggers “Stop Category 0.” The additional notice also confirms that if a fault or violation is detected, a Stop Category 0 is initiated. The student’s conclusion that exceeding the configured stopping time results in a Stop Category 0 aligns with this.
- The student’s supporting point about Recovery is consistent with the facts: after a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted (Recovery), programs cannot run until recovery is completed, recovery imposes specific limits, and violation of those recovery limits results in a Stop Category 0.
- The student’s wording “immediate stop” characterizes Stop Category 0; while the facts don’t explicitly define “immediate,” the outcome (Stop Category 0 on limit violation) is correctly grounded in the provided material. No extraneous or contradictory details were introduced.","Step-by-step reasoning:

- The student states that this constitutes a safety limit violation and results in a safety stop (Stop Category 0). This directly addresses the outcome the question is seeking.
- The answer is concise and focused on the consequence (limit violation leading to an immediate safety stop). The brief mention of recovery is related and does not detract from relevance.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Rationale: The answer is concise, directly answers the question, and correctly identifies the safety response to exceeding the stopping time limit.","Step-by-step reasoning:

- This aligns with the ground truth: a safety limit violation occurs, the robot stops, and recovery is required. The mention of Stop Category 0 adds detail but does not contradict the ground truth.
- The student does not make any conflicting statements and acknowledges the need for recovery following the violation.

Key checks to run:
- Verify all safety inputs and outputs are correctly connected.
- Test all connected safety inputs and outputs (including devices common to multiple machines/robots) to confirm they function as intended.
- Test emergency stop buttons/inputs to verify the robot stops and the brakes engage.
- Test safeguard inputs to confirm robot motion stops; if safeguard reset is configured, check it functions as intended.
- On the initialization screen, activate the reduced input and verify the screen changes.
- Change the operational mode and verify the mode icon changes in the top-right corner of the Polyscope screen.
- Test the 3-position enabling device: pressing to the center-on position should enable motion in manual mode at reduced speed.
- If Emergency Stop outputs are used, press the Emergency Stop push-button and verify the whole system stops.

- Identify the user’s intent: They modified a robot arm and want to know if any checks are required afterward.
- Extract key content from the provided facts: The section titled “Commissioning” explicitly states that the listed tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” It then lists specific checks (verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing emergency stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, enabling device, mode icon, various status outputs, etc.).
- Compare question to facts: The user’s scenario (“after making a modification”) directly matches the condition in the facts, and the facts provide exactly the checks to perform afterward.

Conclusion:
- The facts are directly related to the question and provide the needed post-modification checks.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Scope and timing: The facts state commissioning tests must be done before first use or after modifications. The student mentions after modifications (correct) but omits explicit mention of “before first use.” This is incomplete but not contradictory.
- Test items: The student lists all required checks from the facts:
  - Safety inputs/outputs connected and functioning (including devices common to multiple machines/robots).
  - Emergency stop buttons/inputs stop the robot and engage brakes.
  - Safeguard inputs stop motion; safeguard reset (if configured) functions.
  - Initialization screen reflects reduced input activation.
  - Operational mode change updates the mode icon in the top-right of the PolyScope screen.
  - 3-position enabling device enables motion at reduced speed when pressed to center-on position in manual mode.
  - If Emergency Stop outputs are used, pressing the E-Stop stops the whole system.
  - Outputs for Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode change and are detected.
  - Determine commissioning requirements for the specific application.
- Wording/nuance: Minor wording differences (e.g., “Polyscope” vs “PolyScope,” “additional” in the last bullet) do not introduce new requirements or contradict the facts.
- Hallucinations: No extra procedures or claims beyond what’s in the facts.

1) Student’s main claim about the reaction: They say that if the configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms) is exceeded by the actual stopping time (1000 ms), this is a limit violation and will trigger a Stop Category 0. This aligns with the facts:
- Stopping Time Limit is a configurable safety function that limits the maximum time for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.
- The safety system reactions specify that a Limit Violation results in a Stop Category 0. Additionally, the manual notes that any detected fault or violation initiates a Stop Category 0.

2) Student’s claim about recovery behavior: They state that recovery will be required before programs can be run, and that the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope. This matches the Recovery section:
- “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.”
- “You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated.”
- “The robot arm can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.”

3) Hallucination check: The student does not introduce features or behaviors not in the provided facts. The numeric example (200 ms vs 1000 ms) is a hypothetical consistent with the defined safety function. No extraneous standards, hardware, or procedures are added.

Conclusion: The answer is fully supported by the provided facts and contains no hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the safety limit (200 ms).
- The student states that this constitutes a safety limit violation, resulting in a stop (specifically Stop Category 0) and requiring recovery before programs can run.
- This directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit: a safety stop and required recovery.
- The added note about using Freedrive or Move tab to recover is relevant operational guidance, though slightly beyond the minimal requirement.
- The answer is concise and focused, with only minor extra detail.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- The student’s answer is concise, on-topic, and helps answer the question by explaining that a safety violation will trigger a stop and require recovery.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth says that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes a safety limit violation and the robot enters recovery mode.
- In the scenario, 1000 ms > 200 ms, so the limit is violated.
- The student states that a limit violation occurs, a stop is initiated, and recovery is required before running programs. This matches the core outcome in the ground truth: a violation leading to recovery mode.
- The student adds details (Stop Category 0, how to recover) that are not in the ground truth but do not conflict with it.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is consistent with the ground truth and contains no conflicting statements.

- The question asks about a specific safety function: Stopping Time Limit, comparing a configured limit (200 ms) to an actual stop time (1000 ms), and asks what will happen if the actual exceeds the limit.
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated.
- The facts also state how the safety system reacts when a safety limit is exceeded: a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0. Additionally, they note that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and safety outputs reset low.
- Therefore, the facts contain the exact keywords and semantic content needed to answer the question (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0).

- The question asks about the safety function “Stopping Time Limit” and what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured limit (200 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as limiting the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated.
- The facts also state the safety system’s reaction to a “Limit Violation” (which this scenario would be): it triggers a Stop Category 0. They further note that if any safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and all safety outputs reset to low.
- Therefore, the facts contain the exact keywords and mechanisms needed to answer the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student’s main claim is that a limit violation results in the safety system initiating a Stop Category 0. The FACTS explicitly state under “Safety Functions” that a “Limit Violation” triggers “Stop Category 0,” and elsewhere note that a detected fault or violation initiates a Stop Category 0. This directly supports the student’s statement.
- The student’s first supporting point references the Stopping Time Limit as a safety function and implies that exceeding it constitutes a limit violation. The FACTS list Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function with defined accuracy and clarify that exceeding any safety limit is a limit violation monitored by the safety system; thus this inference is consistent with the provided information.
- The second supporting point states that when a safety limit is exceeded, all safety outputs reset to low, the safety system must be restarted, programs cannot run during recovery, and the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. The FACTS confirm each of these: a Notice says all safety outputs reset to low upon any fault or violation; the Recovery section states the system must be restarted, programs cannot run during recovery, and the arm can be moved manually via Freedrive or the Move tab.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time safety limit is 200 ms, and the actual stopping time is 1000 ms.
- Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, the safety limit is exceeded.
- Exceeding a safety limit triggers a safety violation: safety outputs go low, motion is stopped, and the system requires a safety reset before programs can run again.
- The student’s mention of “Stop Category 0” may be implementation-specific and not necessary to answer the question; the key outcome is the safety limit violation and resulting safety stop/recovery.

- The student’s supporting points explicitly describe the recovery behavior (safety outputs reset, restart required), which aligns with the ground truth’s “enter recovery mode.”

Conclusion: The student’s answer captures the essential outcome: a safety limit violation leading to recovery. There are no conflicting statements relative to the ground truth.

- The question asks specifically about “how many safety modes” the arm has and “the names of each.”

- These directly correspond to safety modes and provide both the count (two) and names (Normal, Reduced).
- While the facts also include broader safety functions, inputs/outputs, and warnings, they remain within the domain of safety and contain the exact information needed to answer the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Identify the student’s key claims:
- There are two configurable safety parameter sets: Normal and Reduced.
- Reduced can be activated by being on the reduced side of a trigger plane or via an external trigger; switching can take up to 500 ms.
- There is a Recovery state after a safety limit violation; programs cannot run in Recovery, but the arm can be moved using Freedrive or the Move tab; Recovery limits apply (Joint Speed 30°/s, Speed 250 mm/s, Force 100 N, Momentum 10 kg·m/s, Power 80 W).

2) Check each claim against the provided facts:
- Two parameter sets: Confirmed. Facts state the safety system has “Normal” and “Reduced” sets.
- Activation of Reduced and switching delay: Confirmed with a nuance. Facts state Reduced is active when on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced Plane or when externally triggered by a safety input. They also state that “up to 500 ms” delay applies when using an input to trigger switching (both directions). The student says “switching can take up to 500 ms” without explicitly limiting that to input-triggered switching; however, they do mention external triggering in the same bullet and do not claim the delay applies to plane-triggered switching. This is acceptable and not incorrect, though slightly imprecise. The student omits the 20 mm dual-limit zone around the trigger plane, but omission is not a hallucination.
- Recovery behavior and limits: Confirmed. Facts state Recovery is activated when limits are exceeded (example at startup if a joint position is outside limits), programs cannot run, movement back within limits is allowed via Freedrive or Move tab, and the exact Recovery limits match the student’s values. Also, Stop Category 0 is issued if those limits are violated; the student doesn’t contradict this.

3) Check for hallucinations:
- No content outside the provided facts is introduced. All numbers and behaviors match the source.

Conclusion

Grounded: True

The answer aligns with the facts, contains no hallucinated information, and is accurate aside from a minor precision nuance that the 500 ms switching delay applies specifically to input-triggered changes (the student’s wording is not misleading, just not explicitly constrained).","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: (a) how many safety modes the arm has, and (b) the names of each mode.
- The student identifies Normal and Reduced as “configurable safety parameter sets,” and also mentions a “Recovery state.” This gives the names needed and implies there are three modes in total.
- However, the answer does not explicitly state the total number of modes (“three”) and includes extra operational details (activation triggers, switching delay, and specific recovery limits) that are not requested.
- While the content helps answer the question, the additional detail makes the response less concise than necessary.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: False
- Rationale: The answer contains the correct names and effectively implies the count, but it is not concise and does not explicitly provide the total number of modes as asked. A concise answer would be: three safety modes—Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student names Normal and Reduced as configurable safety parameter sets and also mentions a Recovery state.

- The provided facts explicitly describe the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and state how the safety system reacts to “Limit Violation” and “Fault Detection” (i.e., Stop Category 0 is initiated).
- The facts also note that safety functions dynamically reduce speed to ensure stopping within limits, and if a limit is exceeded, a safety stop occurs.
- These details directly address the scenario in the question (exceeding the stopping time limit), including the specific reaction of the safety system.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Does exceeding a configured safety limit trigger a Stop Category 0?
- Facts state that exceeding any safety limit is a “Limit Violation,” and the reaction is Stop Category 0. This applies to the Stopping Time Limit as it is one of the configurable safety functions. Therefore, the student’s statement that exceeding the Stopping Time Limit results in Stop Category 0 is grounded.

2) What happens to the safety system after a limit violation?
- Facts state that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted (Recovery is activated). During Recovery, programs cannot be run, and the robot can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. The student accurately lists these points.

3) What happens to safety outputs on fault/violation?
- Facts state that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. The student includes this correctly.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- The student states this is a safety limit violation and specifies the reaction: a Safety Stop (Stop Category 0). This directly addresses the “what will happen” part.
- The student adds consequences: safety system enters Recovery, programs cannot run until recovery, manual repositioning is possible, and safety outputs go low. These are logical and relevant follow-on effects of a safety violation and help the reader understand the practical outcome.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Stopping Time Limit enforcement:
- The facts state the Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit dynamically reduce speed so the robot can always be stopped within the limits. Saying the system “enforces the configured stopping time limit” is consistent.

2) Invented numerical values:
- The answer introduces specific values (“stopping time limit is 200 ms” and “robot stops after 1000 ms”) that are not provided in the facts. This is outside the scope and constitutes hallucinated information.

3) Incorrect stop category for limit violations:
- The facts explicitly map reactions: Limit Violation → Stop Category 0; Fault Detection → Stop Category 0; Safeguard Stop → Stop Category 2; Emergency Stop → Stop Category 1.
- The student claims a violation would “trigger a Stop Category 2 (or higher),” which contradicts the facts. For exceeding a safety limit (such as a stopping time limit), the reaction is Stop Category 0, not 2.

4) Recovery description:
- The student is partially correct that the safety system must be restarted after a safety limit is exceeded. However, in recovery you manually move the robot back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab, and certain limits (joint positions, safety planes, tool orientation) are disabled while specific recovery limits apply.

Grounded: False","Relevance: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping-time limit (200 ms) and states an actual stop time (1000 ms), implying the limit is exceeded. The likely outcome is a safety violation leading to a safety stop/fault and a required reset before motion can resume.
- The student explicitly states that exceeding the limit violates the safety setting and that a safety response will be triggered, followed by the need to restart/reset the safety system. This directly addresses “what will happen,” so it helps answer the question.
- The answer is reasonably concise and focused on the consequence (violation and ensuing safety stop/reset). 
- One caveat: specifying “Stop Category 2 (or higher)” is likely over-specific and may be inaccurate or system-dependent. The core point (a safety stop/fault is triggered) remains correct and relevant, but the precise stop category claim could mislead.
- Overall, despite that specificity issue, the response is relevant and helpful to the question’s intent.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that if the robot exceeds the stopping time safety limit (200 ms vs actual 1000 ms), the safety limits are violated and the robot enters recovery mode.
- The student states that exceeding the 200 ms limit constitutes a safety limit violation and triggers a safety stop response, after which recovery procedures are required to restart and move within limits.
- This aligns with the ground truth outcome: a violation leads to recovery mode. The mention of a Stop Category 2 (or higher) does not contradict the ground truth and the overall consequence (entering recovery) is correctly described.

- Scope/timing: The facts say the tests must be done before first use or after modifications. The student mentions “after modifications” but omits “before first use.” This is a minor omission, not a contradiction.
- Safety I/O: The facts require verifying connections and testing all connected safety inputs/outputs, explicitly including devices common to multiple machines/robots.

- Emergency stop: The student correctly states testing E-stop buttons/inputs to verify robot stops and brakes engage, matching the facts.
- Safeguard inputs and reset: The student includes testing safeguard inputs and, if configured, the safeguard reset—matches the facts.
- Initialization screen and reduced input: The student includes activating reduced input and verifying the screen changes—matches.

- The question asks about the outcome when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds a configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms).
- The provided facts include detailed descriptions of the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function, its purpose, and how safety functions act when limits are exceeded.
- Specifically relevant excerpts:
  - “Stopping Time Limit” is a configurable safety function.
  - “The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded…”
  - “Trigger → Reaction: Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
  - “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.”
- These directly address what happens when a stopping-time limit is violated.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Grounded: False

Reasoning:
- The facts explicitly define the safety system reactions: Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0; Fault Detection -> Stop Category 0; Emergency Stop -> Stop Category 1; Safeguard Stop and 3-Position Enabling (3PE) Stop -> Stop Category 2. There is no mention of a “Stop Category 3.” The student’s claim of “Stop Category 3” is not supported and is incorrect.
- Exceeding a safety limit (including a stopping time or distance limit) is a limit violation, which per the facts triggers Stop Category 0. The student’s mapping is therefore wrong.
- The student introduces example values “1000 ms vs a 200 ms limit,” which are not in the provided facts. This is outside the scope and constitutes hallucinated detail.
- The student states “the document specifies stopping time limits (e.g., 50 ms).” The facts list “Stopping Time Limit” with an accuracy of 50 ms, not a fixed limit value of 50 ms. This is a misinterpretation.
- Correct elements in the student answer: safety outputs reset to low on fault/violation, and recovery is required after a safety limit is exceeded. These are grounded in the facts. However, the incorrect stop category and invented timing values render the overall answer not grounded.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- What the question asks: It’s a simple conditional scenario. If the configured stopping-time safety limit is 200 ms and the actual stop takes 1000 ms, what happens? The expected response is that exceeding the limit triggers a safety reaction/fault, puts the system into a safe state, and requires a reset/recovery before motion can resume.
- What the student got right: They conveyed the core idea that a safety stop is triggered and recovery is required before resuming. This does help answer the question.
- Issues with the answer:
  - Not concise: It includes extraneous references (e.g., a 50 ms example, quoting a document section) that are not needed to answer this specific scenario.
  - Potentially incorrect/misleading detail: “Stop Category 3” is not a standard stop category in IEC 60204-1 (categories are 0, 1, 2). This mixes concepts (likely confusing “Category 3” from ISO 13849 performance levels).
  - Extra verbiage about outputs resetting and general safety function behavior is beyond what’s needed for the question and may distract.

Conclusion: Although the core idea is present, the response is not concise and contains an inaccurate/irrelevant detail, so it does not meet all criteria.

Relevance: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode due to a safety limit violation.
- The scenario given (1000 ms actual vs 200 ms limit) is a clear violation.
- The student concludes that the system will trigger a safety stop and require recovery before resuming, which aligns with the ground truth.

- The QUESTION is about the Stopping Time safety limit: set to 200 ms, actual stop took 1000 ms, and asks what happens.
- The FACTS explicitly define the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and state that the safety system monitors safety limits.
- The FACTS also specify the system reaction: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” and that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.
- Therefore, these FACTS directly address what happens when the stopping time exceeds the configured limit.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify what the facts say about exceeding a safety limit:
- The document states that if the safety system detects a fault or a violation (including a safety limit being exceeded), a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- In the Safety Functions reactions table: Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0; Safeguard Stop -> Stop Category 2; Emergency Stop -> Stop Category 1.

2) Apply this to the Stopping Time Limit:
- Stopping Time Limit is one of the configurable safety functions. Exceeding it is a safety limit violation, which, per the table and notice, triggers Stop Category 0, not Stop Category 2.

3) Compare to the student’s claim:
- The student says it would trigger “a Stop Category 2 (safeguard) or Stop depending on the exact condition.” This is not supported for a stopping time limit violation; the correct reaction is Stop Category 0. Suggesting Category 2 here is incorrect and not grounded in the facts.

4) Check the recovery statement:
- The student’s description of recovery is consistent with the facts: after a safety limit violation, recovery is activated; programs cannot run; the robot can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab.

Conclusion:
- While the recovery portion is grounded, the core claim about the stop category is not aligned with the documented reactions to a safety limit violation.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks a very specific cause–effect outcome: with a stopping time limit of 200 ms and an actual stop time of 1000 ms, what happens?
- The student’s core statement correctly identifies the key consequence: exceeding the stopping time limit leads to a safety stop.
- However, the answer introduces extra details (Stop Category 2 vs. other stops, document references, and recovery procedures like Freedrive/Move tab) that are not necessary to answer the specific question. This reduces conciseness.
- Despite the extra content, the main point directly addresses the question and helps the reader understand the outcome.

  - Recovery mode is explicitly referenced (“in recovery mode”).
- The student correctly notes the Safety Parameter Set with Normal and Reduced configurations and mentions Recovery mode, which is supported by the text.
- However, the claim that “The document does not specify named ‘safety modes’ for the arm” is incorrect because “Reduced Mode” is clearly named, and “Automatic/Manual mode” are also specified in the safety I/O context.

- The question asks about exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) and what the system does if the actual stop takes 1000 ms.
- The provided facts explicitly define the Stopping Time Limit safety function (“Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated”) and explain that safety functions monitor limits and react to violations.
- The reactions table states that a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0, and notices reiterate that any safety fault/violation results in a Stop Category 0 and safety outputs resetting low.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the mechanism and consequence relevant to the question.
- While there are some tangential items (e.g., electrical voltage warning, force-limit exceptions, workspace pinch hazards), per the rubric the presence of clearly related safety-function content makes the set relevant.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True

Why: The facts include the Stopping Time Limit definition and the system’s reaction to limit violations (Stop Category 0), which directly pertains to what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured limit (200 ms).","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The FACTS list “Stopping Time Limit” as one of the configurable safety functions and show “50 ms” in the Safety Function Accuracy table. The student’s mention that the table shows 50 ms is consistent with the provided data (though it reflects accuracy, not a specific configured limit value).
- The FACTS state that when any safety limit is exceeded (a “Limit Violation”) or a fault is detected, the reaction is a Stop Category 0. The student states that exceeding the stopping time limit leads to a fault/stop condition and that limit violations or faults trigger a Stop Category 0. This matches the FACTS.
- No information outside the provided FACTS is introduced. The answer stays within scope and correctly ties the stopping time limit exceedance to the Stop Category 0 behavior.

Minor note:
- The “50 ms” in the table refers to the accuracy figure for the Stopping Time Limit safety function, not necessarily the configured limit itself. However, the student did not claim it was the configured limit, only referenced it from the table, so this does not make the answer ungrounded.","Relevance: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question posits a configured stopping time limit of 200 ms and an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which clearly exceeds the limit.
- Exceeding a safety stopping time limit is a fault condition that triggers the safety function.
- The expected behavior in such a case is a safety stop; commonly this is a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power) and a fault that requires reset.
- The student’s answer states that exceeding the stopping time limit leads to a fault/stop and specifies Stop Category 0. This directly addresses what will happen.
- While the reference to a “50 ms in the table” is extraneous, the core answer is concise enough and relevant to the scenario.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is relevant and helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario states the stopping time safety limit is 200 ms and the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms, which is a violation.
- The ground truth specifies that when the safety limit is violated, the robot arm enters recovery mode.
- The student answer states that exceeding the limit triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate stop) and describes a general fault/stop condition, but does not indicate entering recovery mode.
- This outcome differs from the ground truth’s specified behavior (recovery mode), so the student’s answer does not match the required result.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

- Identify the student’s core claims:

  3) Reduced can be activated either when the tool/end effector is on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced Plane or via an external safety input, with up to 500 ms transition (they specifically mention normal-to-reduced).

- Compare with the provided facts:
  - The facts state the safety system has configurable parameters “Normal” and “Reduced.” This matches claim (1) and (2).
  - The facts state Reduced can be activated when the tool/end effector is on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced Plane or via a safety input. This matches claim (3).
  - The facts also state that when switching via input, up to 500 ms can elapse before new limits become active, in either direction (normal→reduced or reduced→normal). The student mentions the 500 ms for normal→reduced; while not mentioning the reverse direction, this is still accurate and not contradictory.

- The student states that a safety limit violation will trigger a Stop Category 0. This matches the FACTS, which specify that both limit violations and fault detection lead to Stop Category 0.
- The student says Recovery is required before running programs, and the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope. This aligns with the Recovery section, which says you cannot run programs during Recovery and you can manually move the robot back within limits using those methods.
- The student claims that if a fault or violation is detected, all safety outputs reset to low. This matches the notice stating that any detected fault or violation causes all safety outputs to reset to low.

- The question asks what happens when the actual stop time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms). The core expectation is an explanation of the consequence (i.e., a safety violation and resulting stop behavior).
- The student’s first bullet directly addresses this by stating it’s a safety limit violation and that it will trigger a stop (they specify Stop Category 0). This directly answers “what will happen.”
- The second bullet describes the required recovery action and how to exit the condition. While slightly beyond the exact question, it remains relevant to the consequence and is concise.
- The third bullet explains the state of safety outputs upon a fault/violation, which is also a direct consequence of exceeding the safety limit.

- The question asks about the consequence when the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds a configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms). So relevant facts would define “Stopping Time Limit” and describe what happens when a safety limit is violated.
- The provided facts explicitly define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated.
- The facts also describe the safety system’s reactions, including that a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- Therefore, the facts contain direct keywords and semantics tied to the question (“Stopping Time Limit,” “limit violation,” “Stop Category 0”), and they provide the exact mechanism needed to infer what happens.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The provided FACTS describe Universal Robots safety-related functions, interfaces, inputs/outputs, stop categories, safety parameter sets (Normal/Reduced), recovery limits, and associated warnings and notices, including specific performance levels and accuracies.
- The STUDENT ANSWER is empty and contains no statements, references, or explanations.
- Because there is no content, the answer does not demonstrate grounding in the FACTS and does not address any of the factual material.
- While the answer does not introduce any hallucinated information, it fails criterion (1): being grounded in the FACTS.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the stopping time safety limit is 200 ms and the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. This requires an explanation of the consequence of exceeding the safety limit.
- The student provided no answer (blank). 
- While the response is technically concise, it is not relevant because it gives no information and does not address the question.
- It does not help answer the question or demonstrate understanding of the safety limit implications.

Relevance: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The safety limit is 200 ms, and the actual stopping time was 1000 ms. This exceeds the limit, which constitutes a safety limit violation.
- According to the ground truth, a violation of the stopping time safety limit causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode.
- The student provided no answer, so they did not state the required outcome.

Grounded: True","Step 1: Identify what the question asks
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after making a modification to a robot arm. This implies looking for post-modification verification or commissioning steps.

Step 2: Compare the student’s response to the intent
- The student clearly answers “Yes” and directs the user to perform commissioning tests, which are precisely the kind of post-modification checks the question implies.
- They list concrete categories of checks: safety I/O and emergency-stop, UI/enabling device, and system outputs. These are appropriate and actionable for verifying safe and correct operation after changes.

Step 3: Evaluate conciseness and relevance
- The answer remains on-topic and focused on checks to perform after modification.
- While detailed, the detail is directly relevant and helps the user understand what to check. It is reasonably concise for a safety-critical context.

Step 4: Assess whether it helps answer the question
- It not only confirms that checks are needed but also specifies what to check, which meaningfully helps the user.

Relevance: True","Correctness: True

Reasoning:
- The ground truth lists a comprehensive set of post-modification commissioning checks: verifying safety I/O connections and function, testing emergency stops and brake engagement, testing safeguard inputs and reset, confirming reduced mode indication on the initialization screen, verifying mode icon changes in PolyScope, testing the 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual motion, verifying system stop via Emergency Stop outputs (if used), testing outputs like Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced, and determining application-specific commissioning requirements.
- The student’s answer includes all these items accurately, grouped into logical categories (Safety I/O and E-stop; UI and enabling device; system outputs and commissioning scope).
- There are no contradictions or omissions relative to the ground truth, and the added reference to the commissioning section does not conflict with the required checks.",resp_0cc142376499bb600068f686b09bd881a0a44122fbeda37db8,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,completed,1760986800.0,981,4364,5345
