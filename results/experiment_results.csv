1) The question asks: How many safety modes the arm has and their names. So we look for mentions of “safety mode(s)” or named modes tied to the safety system.
2) In the provided facts:
- Safety Planes section defines modes tied to the safety system: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode.
- Tool Direction Restriction also maps limits to safety system modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
- Multiple references to “Normal mode” and “Reduced mode” explicitly describe safety system states.
3) Although the facts include much additional material (programming, specs, run tab, etc.), the presence of explicit safety modes and their names makes the facts relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s claim: “The robot safety system has three modes: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.”
2) Check the FACTS for safety system modes:
   - The safety system itself operates in Normal and Reduced modes (e.g., planes/limits are “active when the safety system is in Normal/Reduced mode”).
   - “Disabled” appears as a configuration state for specific safety functions (e.g., safety planes or tool direction limits) meaning that particular plane/limit is never active, not as a mode of the overall safety system.
3) Check available modes/states for safety planes and tool direction:
   - Safety planes list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode.
   - Tool Direction limit list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
   - This shows more than three states are available for these functions and that “Disabled” is a per-function state, not a global safety system mode.
4) Conclusion: The student conflates the safety system’s global modes (Normal and Reduced) with per-function states (Disabled), and omits other documented modes/states (Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode). Therefore the statement is not accurate and not fully grounded in the provided facts.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: (a) the number of safety modes the arm has, and (b) the names of each mode.
- The student answer states there are three modes and lists them: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.
- The response is concise and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary information.
- Including a reference does not detract from relevance and the content still clearly answers the question.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student also states there are three modes, which matches the count.
- However, for the names, the student lists Normal, Reduced, and Disabled. While Normal and Reduced match, ""Disabled"" does not match ""Recovery.""

- The QUESTION is about the Stopping Time Limit safety function and what happens if the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit (200 ms vs. 1000 ms).
- The FACTS explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses to stop after a stop is initiated.
- The FACTS also state the safety system reactions: when a safety limit is violated (Limit Violation), the system initiates a Stop Category 0, and elsewhere note that all safety outputs reset to low upon fault/violation.
- These items directly address the condition in the QUESTION (exceeding the stopping time limit) and the ensuing system behavior.
- While the FACTS include additional sections (e.g., fieldbus, MODBUS, PROFIsafe) that aren’t necessary to answer this specific question, criterion (2) says any related content makes the set relevant.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Reasoning:
1) Identify the relevant facts:
- Stopping Time Limit “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The safety system monitors safety limits, and a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- Stop Category 0 is defined as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.

2) Apply the facts to the scenario:
- If the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the actual stopping time is 1000 ms, the robot has exceeded a configured safety limit (i.e., a limit violation of the Stopping Time Limit).

3) Determine the safety reaction per the facts:
- A Limit Violation causes a Stop Category 0, which corresponds to immediate removal of power to the arm.

4) Check for hallucinations:
- The student’s statements and terminology (Stopping Time Limit, Limit Violation, Stop Category 0, immediate removal of power) match the provided facts. No unsupported claims are introduced.

Conclusion:
Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- The student states that this constitutes a limit violation and describes the resulting action: a Stop Category 0 with immediate power removal.
- This directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit and clearly explains the expected system behavior.
- The answer is concise, focused on the scenario, and adds a relevant detail (Stop Category 0) that helps clarify the outcome.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit set to 200 ms, but the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. This is a clear safety limit violation.
- According to the ground truth, the consequence of such a violation is that the robot arm will enter recovery mode because the safety limits have been violated.
- The student states that the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal) upon the violation. This outcome differs from the ground truth, which specifies entering recovery mode as the relevant system state/outcome.
- The student answer does not mention entering recovery mode and instead specifies a different response (Stop Category 0), which conflicts with the ground truth description of what happens.

- Scan the provided facts for matching concepts/keywords:
  - Directly relevant:
    - “Safety for Maintenance” explicitly states: After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level, and all safety functions shall be tested.
    - 15.1 Testing Stopping Performance: Advises periodic testing of stopping performance, with notes on when monitoring/testing is or isn’t required.
    - 15.2 Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection + Inspection Plan: Includes concrete checks (cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings) and a simple functional test in Freedrive to verify the arm can hold position.
    - Warnings about power-off, grounding, and ESD during maintenance are ancillary but tied to maintenance/repair context.
    - 15.3 Log Tab: Can be used to review errors/faults after changes—supportive to post-modification checks.

  - Possibly relevant depending on the nature of the modification:
    - Software Safety Restrictions (safety planes, tool direction/position restrictions): If the modification affects tools/end-effector geometry or workspace limits, these settings may need verification.
  
  - Largely unrelated to the specific question:
    - Cybersecurity sections (11.x), Program and Installation Manager (15.4), Accessing Robot Data (15.5), Assembly and mounting, workspace, dimensioning the stand, control box clearance, cable/mains connections. These do not address checks after a modification, though they are general setup/safety info.

The FACTS state: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Citing the need to follow the Service Manual and Chapter 5’s inspection plan for trained individuals matches the FACTS: maintenance/inspection/repair must follow the latest Service Manual; repairs should be done by UR or trained individuals per the Service Manual; Chapter 5 contains the full inspection plan.
- Powering down and unplugging the Control Box, observing ESD precautions, checking earth connection before re-powering, and testing safety functions after reassembly are all explicitly listed under the safety warnings in the Maintenance section.
- Performing the specific inspection items (flat rings, robot cable and connections, base and tool mounting bolts) and replacing any damaged parts aligns with the Robot Arm Inspection Plan and its checklist, including the instruction to replace worn/damaged flat rings.

- The ground truth states that after a modification, specific safety checks and tests must be performed (e.g., verifying safety I/O connections, testing emergency stops and brakes, safeguard inputs/resets, reduced mode indications, mode changes, enabling device behavior, and related outputs).
- The student answer affirms that checks are required after maintenance/repair/modification and explicitly mentions testing safety functions after reassembly. This aligns with the ground truth’s requirement to test safety functions.
- The student also adds general maintenance/repair procedures (powering down, ESD precautions, inspections), which do not conflict with the ground truth.

1) The question asks specifically about “safety modes” and their names.
2) In the provided facts, the Safety Planes “Modes” section explicitly lists safety-related modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. These reference the safety system states (Normal and Reduced) and how planes behave in those states.
3) The Tool Direction restriction section also uses the same safety mode options (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced).
4) Additional mode mentions (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode) are operational modes rather than safety modes, but they are still semantically related to “modes of the arm,” and the documents tie Reduced/Normal behavior to the safety system.
5) Although the facts include a lot of unrelated material (programming, program tree, specifications), they contain clear, keyword-matching and semantically relevant information about safety modes.

Conclusion: The facts are relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the relevant facts: In the “Safety Planes” section, the manual lists the configurable Modes for each safety plane as: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. It also clarifies these are plane configuration modes, not the robot’s “operational modes.” Separately, “operational modes” in the manual refer to Automatic and Manual (and Recovery/Backdrive contexts), while the “safety system” can be in Normal or Reduced states.
2. Compare to the student answer: The student lists four items—Normal, Reduced, Disabled, and Trigger Reduced Mode—omitting “Normal & Reduced.”
3. Check correctness of framing: The student states “the arm’s safety system has four operational safety modes,” which conflates concepts. The four items listed are safety plane configuration options, not “operational safety modes” of the arm or safety system. The manual’s “operational modes” are Automatic/Manual; the safety system states are Normal/Reduced; and the plane has five configuration modes.
4. Check for hallucination: The listed four terms do appear in the facts, so there is no invented mode. However, the omission of “Normal & Reduced” and the mischaracterization of what these modes represent make the statement inaccurate.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS state that if a safety limit is violated, the safety reaction is Stop Category 0, and if a fault is detected, the reaction is also Stop Category 0 (10.2.2 Safety Functions, Trigger/Reaction table).
- The description of Stop Category 0 as “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors” appears in the PROFIsafe status message definitions (12.5 PROFIsafe, status message “Stop, cat. 0”).
- The FACTS also specify that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low (10.2.2, NOTICE).
- Therefore, in the hypothetical where the Stopping Time Limit is set to 200 ms and the robot takes 1000 ms to stop, that constitutes a limit violation, which correctly maps to Stop Category 0 and resetting all safety outputs to low.

- While many other sections (e.g., cybersecurity, program manager, safety plane configuration, assembly details) are not directly about post-modification checks, the presence of multiple directly relevant items satisfies the relevance criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Core requirement after maintenance/repair
- Student: Says checks must be performed after maintenance/repair to ensure required safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
- Facts: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Match: Accurate.

2) Power isolation and grounding
- Student: Unplug main power before work and check earth connection before re-powering.
- Facts: “Unplug the main power cable… Check the earth connection before re-powering the system.”
- Match: Accurate.

3) Stopping performance testing
- Student: Recommends periodic stop-performance testing and notes continuous monitoring when stop time/distance safety functions are used.
- Facts: “Test periodically to determine if stopping performance is degraded… If stop time and/or stop distance safety functions are used… no monitoring or testing… required. The robot does continuous monitoring.”
- Match: Accurate and complete.

4) Physical inspection checklist
- Student: Inspect robot cable and connections, base mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings; move to ZERO and follow inspection steps; rectify/replace unacceptable parts.
- Facts: The inspection plan specifies ZERO position, power off/disconnect, inspect cable, check base/tool bolts, inspect/replace flat rings, and rectify/replace unacceptable parts.
- Match: Accurate. Adding “any modified components” is a reasonable generalization and does not contradict the manual.

5) Functional check in Freedrive
- Student: Verify correct operation in Freedrive and that the arm maintains position without support and without activating Freedrive.
- Facts: Procedure describes entering Freedrive via 3PE, moving to horizontally elongated position, releasing, and verifying it maintains position without support and without Freedrive.
- Match: Accurate.

6) Warranty notice
- Student: If damage observed within warranty, contact the distributor.
- Facts: “If any damage is observed on a robot within the warranty period, contact the distributor…”
- Match: Accurate.

7) Hallucinations check
- The student did not introduce procedures, chemicals, cybersecurity, or other items outside the provided maintenance/inspection scope. All points map to the given text. The brief parenthetical “including modifications” is not contradicted and remains within the maintenance/repair context.

Conclusion

Grounded: True

The student’s answer stays within the provided facts and accurately reflects the manual’s guidance without adding unsupported information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify what the question asks: After modifying a robot arm, are there checks required? The expected answer is whether checks are needed and, ideally, what kinds.
2) Verify the student addressed this: The student clearly says “Yes” and specifies that checks must ensure safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
3) Assess helpfulness: The student lists concrete post-modification checks—power/earth, safety function tests (including stopping performance), physical inspection items, and a functional check (Freedrive/holding position). These directly help the user know what to do.
4) Assess concision and relevance: The bullets are focused on post-modification checks. The brief warranty note is slightly tangential but minimal and does not detract from relevance.

Conclusion: The answer is concise, relevant, and helps answer the question with actionable checks.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth specifies that, after a robot arm modification, a series of safety-related tests must be performed (verify safety I/O connections, test E-stops and brake engagement, safeguard inputs and reset, reduced mode indication on the screen, mode icon changes, 3-position enabling device behavior, system response to E-stop outputs, verification of various status outputs, and determining commissioning requirements).
- The student correctly states that checks are required after maintenance/repair/modification and mentions testing safety functions and stopping performance, which aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on post-modification safety testing.
- The student also adds power, physical inspection, and Freedrive functional checks. These additions do not conflict with the ground truth; they are extra recommendations.
- The student does not enumerate several specific checks listed in the ground truth (e.g., UI indicators, 3-position enabling device, explicit E-stop/brake tests, specific output signals). However, omission is not a contradiction, and the answer remains factually consistent with the ground truth’s core message that safety checks are required.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is factually accurate relative to the ground truth and contains no conflicting statements, though it is less specific.

   - “When the safety system is in Reduced mode …”
   - “Normal & Reduced”

- The question asks specifically about the robot arm’s safety modes: how many there are and their names.
- In the provided FACTS, the “Software Safety Restrictions” section repeatedly references the safety system being in “Normal” mode and “Reduced” mode (e.g., Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced options for safety planes; Tool Direction limit active in Normal, Reduced, or both).
- These references indicate the safety modes of the system are Normal and Reduced.
- Although the FACTS also include many unrelated details (programming, Run tab, Move commands, emergency events, operational modes like Manual/Automatic/Recovery/Backdrive), they still contain content directly addressing the safety modes in question.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True

The FACTS contain explicit references to the safety system modes “Normal” and “Reduced,” which directly relate to the question. Even though there is additional unrelated material, the presence of these keywords and semantics makes the FACTS relevant.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify where “modes” are defined in the FACTS. In 10.4 Software Safety Restrictions under “You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes,” the listed options are: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode. These are per-plane configuration modes.

2) Note what the safety system modes are. The text refers to the safety system being in Normal or Reduced mode (e.g., “When the safety system is in Normal mode…”). Thus, “Normal” and “Reduced” are system states; “Disabled,” “Normal & Reduced,” and “Trigger Reduced Mode” are plane configuration options defining when a plane is active or how it behaves.

3) Compare with the student’s statement. The student claims the arm’s safety system has four named safety modes: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, and Normal & Reduced. This is inaccurate in two ways:
- Omission: The plane configuration also includes “Trigger Reduced Mode,” which the student leaves out.
- Mischaracterization: The student attributes these as “safety system” modes. The FACTS distinguish between safety system modes (Normal, Reduced) and safety plane configuration modes (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode).

4) Conclusion: Because the student both omits a listed mode and conflates plane configuration modes with the safety system’s modes, the answer is not fully grounded in the FACTS.

Grounded: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: the number of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student’s answer provides a specific count (“four”) and lists the names (“Disabled, Normal, Reduced, and Normal & Reduced”).
- The answer is concise and directly addresses the question without unrelated information.
- The brief parenthetical clarifies what “Normal & Reduced” means, which helps interpret the naming rather than distracting from the answer.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Explanation: The student clearly states the number of modes and names each one, in a concise and directly relevant manner that helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.

- The number of modes does not match (4 vs. 3).
- The student omits Recovery mode and introduces modes not listed in the ground truth (Disabled and “Normal & Reduced”).
- Therefore, the student’s answer conflicts with the ground truth in both count and names.

- The question asks what happens if the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured Stopping Time Limit (200 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.
- The facts also state that exceeding any safety limit constitutes a “Limit Violation,” and the safety system reaction to a limit violation is a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- Therefore, the facts directly contain the keywords and semantics needed to answer the question (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0).

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS state that Stopping Time Limit is a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated. Exceeding any configured safety limit is treated as a “Limit Violation.”
- The “Reactions of the safety system” table specifies that a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- The FACTS also define Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors.
- The student’s scenario (configured limit = 200 ms; actual stopping time = 1000 ms) clearly implies the stopping time exceeded the configured limit, i.e., a limit violation.
- The student concludes that this results in a Stop Category 0 and describes it as immediate removal of power to the arm, which matches the definition in the FACTS.
- The student does not introduce any unsupported claims; the numeric example is illustrative and consistent with the described mechanism.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided FACTS and contains no hallucinated information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) and reports an actual stop time (1000 ms).
- Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this constitutes a stopping time limit violation.
- Safety systems are designed to react to such violations by initiating a safety stop.
- The student specifies the reaction as a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal), which is a plausible and commonly defined response for a safety limit violation in many robot systems.

- The answer is concise and directly addresses what will happen: a limit violation leading to an immediate safety stop.
- It clearly helps answer the question by explaining the consequence of exceeding the limit.

Reasoning:
- The scenario describes exceeding the stopping time safety limit (200 ms limit vs. 1000 ms actual), which is a safety limit violation.
- The ground truth specifies that, upon such a violation, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Identify the student’s claims
- After maintenance or repair, safety checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and verify all safety functions.
- Checks must follow national/regional work safety regulations and the Service Manual (with Chapter 5 for trained-individual inspection plans).
- Specific precautions: power down/unplug Control Box, observe ESD, prevent water/dust ingress, check earth connection before re-powering, and verify safety functions after reassembly.
- Perform periodic inspections (flat rings, robot cable and connections, base/tool mounting bolts) according to the inspection plan and replace/rectify unacceptable parts.
- Parenthetical: includes “including modifications.”

2) Compare each claim to the provided FACTS
- Post-maintenance/repair safety checks and testing safety functions: Explicitly stated. “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Adherence to national/regional regulations and Service Manual/Chapter 5: Explicitly stated. The text requires compliance with safety instructions, local requirements, and the latest Service Manual; Chapter 5 is cited for inspection plans for trained individuals.
- Specific precautions (unplug main power, check earth, observe ESD, prevent water/dust): Explicitly listed under warnings.
- Periodic inspections of flat rings, robot cable/connections, base and tool mounting bolts with replacement/rectification if unacceptable: Explicitly covered in the Robot Arm Inspection Plan and associated instructions.
- Timeframes (monthly/biannual/annual): The inspection plan table includes these timeframes; the student’s general statement aligns with the table’s structure.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope content
- The parenthetical “including modifications” is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt. However, it does not introduce any new procedures or contradict the text; it simply broadens the context to modifications as a type of maintenance/repair activity. All actionable guidance the student lists remains directly supported by the FACTS.

2) Does the student answer address this? Yes. It explicitly says checks must be done after maintenance/repair/modifications to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of safety functions.
3) Is it concise and relevant? Mostly. The core statement is concise and on-point. However, part of the supporting points include pre-work precautions (powering down, ESD, ingress prevention) that are not strictly “afterwards,” which slightly reduces focus. The rest (verifying safety functions, following the service manual, and performing inspections) are directly relevant.

- The ground truth says: Yes, checks are required after a modification, and it lists specific safety-related tests (verify safety I/O connections, test all safety I/O, E-stops with brake engagement, safeguard inputs/reset, reduced mode indication, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, E-stop outputs behavior, and verifying external outputs; also determine commissioning requirements).
- The student answer says: Yes, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of all safety functions, and it references doing checks per regulations and the service manual. It also mentions general precautions (power down, ESD, ingress protection, earth connection) and performing inspections, and explicitly says to verify correct functioning of all safety functions after reassembly.

Assessment against criteria:
- Factually accurate relative to the ground truth: The student confirms that checks are needed and that safety functions must be verified, which aligns with the ground truth’s intent. Nothing contradicts the ground truth.
- No conflicting statements: None present.
- Completeness is not required by the rubric; while the student omits the specific individual tests (E-stop, enabling device, mode icon, outputs), their general statement to verify all safety functions is consistent with those specifics.

Reasoning:
- The student claims the arm’s safety system has three modes: Normal, Reduced, and Disabled.
- In the provided facts, “Normal” and “Reduced” are indeed safety system modes. For example, safety planes and tool direction limits reference activation “when the safety system is in Normal mode” or “in Reduced mode.”
- “Disabled,” however, is not a safety system mode in the facts. “Disabled” refers to the state of a specific safety function (e.g., a safety plane or the tool direction limit) being turned off: “The safety plane is never active in this state” and “Disabled Tool direction limit — Never active.” This does not describe a global safety system mode.
- The facts also list additional plane configuration modes (“Normal & Reduced” and “Trigger Reduced Mode”), which the student omitted. While completeness wasn’t required, asserting “three modes” and labeling “Disabled” as a safety system mode conflicts with the source.

Conclusion: The facts contain clear, directly relevant guidance about checks to perform after modifying the robot arm.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s claims:
- After maintenance, repair (and modification), checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and correct operation of all safety functions.
- Maintenance/inspection/calibration/repair must follow the Service Manual; repairs by UR or trained designated individuals per the Service Manual.
- After work, verify safety functions and follow national/regional work safety regulations.
- When disassembling robot arm or Control Box: unplug main power and prevent re-energization, check earth connection before re-powering, observe ESD precautions, prevent water/dust ingress, and be aware that high voltage can remain for hours in the Control Box power supply.

2) Map claims to the provided FACTS:
- “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested. Checks must adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations.” This directly supports the student’s main claim about post-work safety checks and regulations.
- “Conduct all maintenance, inspection, calibration and repair work according to the latest version of Service Manual… Repair work should only be done by Universal Robots. Client designated, trained individuals can do repair work, provided they follow the Service Manual.” This supports the Service Manual and qualified personnel statements.
- Warnings under Maintenance: unplug main power, prevent others from powering on, check earth connection before re-powering, observe ESD, prevent water/dust. “WARNING: ELECTRICITY… high voltages (up to 600 V) can be present… for several hours after the Control Box has been switched off.” These match the student’s safety procedure details.

3) Check for information outside scope (“hallucinations”):
- The student adds “or modification” to “maintenance and repair.” While “modification” is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the rest of the content is directly grounded in the FACTS. This addition does not contradict the manual’s guidance and is a reasonable extension, but it is not explicitly stated in the excerpt.

- The supporting details about following the Service Manual and verifying safety functions further reinforce the answer and help the user understand what to check and who should perform it.
- Some additional points (unplugging power, ESD, residual voltage) are more about safe maintenance procedures rather than post-modification checks. While slightly beyond the narrow scope, they are still related to the maintenance context and do not detract from the relevance.
- Overall, the answer is clear, actionable, and sufficiently concise for the question asked.

- The question asks about the robot’s safety modes and their names.
- The provided facts explicitly discuss safety-related modes multiple times:
  - Safety Planes “Modes” section lists Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode, and Disabled, and explains how they behave when the safety system is in Normal or Reduced mode.
  - Tool Direction restriction also uses the same safety mode states (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced).
- The facts also describe operational modes (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, Backdrive). While these are operational rather than “safety modes,” they are still closely related to system modes and reference reduced speed and safety plane usage, reinforcing relevance to the concept of modes in a safety context.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True
The facts contain direct references to safety modes (Normal and Reduced) and related mode states used in safety features, thus they are relevant to the question.","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Safety-plane modes
- Facts list five configurable safety-plane modes: Disabled; Normal; Reduced; Normal & Reduced; Trigger Reduced Mode.
- The student lists exactly these five. This matches the facts.

2) Operational/safety-related modes
- Facts list operational modes: Automatic, Manual, and High Speed Manual Mode. They also describe Recovery Mode (a type of Manual Mode) and Backdrive (a Manual Mode used to force joints).
- The student identifies the same set and characterizes Recovery Mode and Backdrive consistently with the facts.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope claims
- The student does not introduce additional modes or behaviors not present in the facts.
- The brief bracketed citations are references and do not assert new technical content beyond the provided facts.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is fully consistent with the provided facts and contains no hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for the number of safety modes the arm has and the names of each.
- The student anticipates ambiguity and provides two interpretations:
  - Safety-plane (configurable safety) modes: lists a count (five) and names each mode.
  - Operational/safety-related robot modes: lists main modes and related states, with names.
- This directly addresses “how many” and “what are the names” in both plausible senses of “safety modes.”
- The response is concise and focused on the requested information, without unnecessary digression.
- Even if the second list mixes “operational” with “safety-related,” the student clearly labels the distinction, which helps answer the question given potential ambiguity.

- The ground truth states the arm has three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- The student lists two different sets:

- The question asks about a safety Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) and an actual stop that takes longer (1000 ms), and what happens in that case.
- The provided facts include a dedicated section on Safety Functions, explicitly listing “Stopping Time Limit” and explaining that these functions “dynamically reduce the speed of the robot motion such that it can always be stopped within the limits.”
- The facts also state the safety system reactions: for a “Limit Violation,” the reaction is “Stop Category 0.” This directly addresses what happens when a safety limit (such as stopping time) is exceeded.
- Additional corroborating details appear in the Recovery section and in the summary note that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, safety outputs reset to low.

Conclusion:
- The facts contain the exact safety function (Stopping Time Limit) and the defined reaction to exceeding it (Stop Category 0). Therefore, they are directly relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

1) Does a Stopping Time Limit violation trigger a Stop Category 0?
- The facts state that any “Limit Violation” triggers Stop Category 0 (10.2.2 Safety Functions, Trigger/Reaction table). Exceeding the Stopping Time Limit is a safety limit violation, so treating it as a Limit Violation with Stop Category 0 is correct.

2) Is the description of Stop Category 0 accurate?
- The facts define Stop Category 0 as a “hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors” (PROFIsafe status message definitions). The student’s description matches this.

3) Do safety outputs reset low on violation/fault?
- The facts state: “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low” (10.2.2). The student states this correctly.

4) Must the safety system be restarted and are programs blocked until recovery is done?
- The facts state: “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted.” Also, when Recovery is activated, “You cannot run programs… but the robot arm can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope” (Safety Parameter Set – Recovery). The student’s statements align with this.

Conclusion
- The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided facts and does not introduce information outside the scope.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured stopping time safety limit (200 ms). So we’re looking for the system’s response to a limit violation.
- The student explicitly identifies this as a Stopping Time Limit violation and states the consequence: a safety stop (Stop Category 0).
- They add brief, relevant consequences of that stop: power removal, safety outputs go low, restart required, and how to recover. These details directly describe what “will happen” after the violation.
- The answer stays focused on the safety reaction and recovery; it doesn’t wander into unrelated topics. While it includes a couple of extra details, they are still pertinent.

- They list specific safety precautions for power isolation (power down via Teach Pendant, unplug mains, wait ~30 seconds, unplug main power at Control Box), and to observe ESD, prevent water/dust ingress, and check earth/ground before re-powering.
- They outline a robot arm inspection plan (ZERO position if possible, disconnect power, inspect cable, check base and tool flange bolts, inspect/replace flat rings, contact distributor if damaged within warranty).
- They describe functional verification steps (unmount tools or set TCP/payload/CoG, Freedrive procedure using the 3PE button, hold a horizontally elongated pose without support, periodic testing of stopping performance to detect degradation).

2) Check alignment with provided facts
- Post-maintenance checks and testing safety functions: Matches “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level… The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.”
- Power isolation and safety precautions: All listed points are present in the facts: pressing the power button, unplugging the mains, waiting ~30 seconds, unplugging the main power cable at the Control Box, observing ESD, preventing water/dust entry, and checking earth connection.
- Robot Arm Inspection Plan: Steps match the listed inspection plan (ZERO position, power off/disconnect, cable inspection, tightening base and tool flange bolts, inspecting/replacing flat rings, and contacting the distributor if damage is found within warranty).
- Functional verification: Unmount tools or set TCP/payload/CoG as specified; Freedrive activation via 3PE button press sequence; verifying the arm maintains a horizontally elongated position without support and without Freedrive; periodic testing of stopping performance is explicitly described in the facts.
- The student did not contradict the exception noted in the facts that if stop time/distance safety functions are used as the basis of risk reduction, no monitoring/testing is required; they simply omitted this nuance, which does not introduce error.

- The FACTS also reference the safety system being in either Normal or Reduced mode (e.g., “When the safety system is in Normal mode…” and “When the safety system is in Reduced mode…”), which supports the idea of two primary safety system modes.
- The student’s statement that there are “two primary modes: Normal and Reduced” is consistent with the FACTS.
- The student’s list of safety plane configurations exactly matches the options given in the FACTS, and the explanation of Trigger Reduced Mode aligns with the provided description (“when crossed” vs. “positioned beyond it” is equivalent).

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student’s main claim is that a safety limit violation will initiate a Stop Category 0. This matches the provided facts: under “Safety Functions,” a “Limit Violation” triggers “Stop Category 0,” and “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.”
- The student cites the Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety limit and implies that exceeding it constitutes a limit violation. That is consistent with the document: Stopping Time Limit is a safety function, and exceeding any configured safety limit is a limit violation that triggers Stop Category 0.
- The student says that when a safety limit is exceeded, all safety outputs reset to low. This is explicitly supported by the notice stating that any fault or violation resets all safety outputs to low.
- The student states that Recovery is activated and you cannot run programs until the safety system is restarted, and that the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. The manual’s Recovery section supports that Recovery mode prevents program execution and allows manual movement to get back within limits. The text explicitly gives Recovery activation as an example when limits are exceeded at startup (e.g., joint position outside a limit). While the student phrases Recovery activation as general, it is still within the scope of the provided information and not introducing external facts.

Minor nuance:
- The manual presents Recovery activation explicitly in the startup/out-of-limits example; it does not state that Recovery is always activated for every limit violation. The student’s unconditional phrasing slightly overgeneralizes, but it remains grounded in the document and does not introduce information outside the scope.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and states the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this exceeds the configured limit, so it is a safety limit violation.
- The student states it is a safety limit violation and that the safety system will initiate a stop (they specify Stop Category 0) and then provides relevant consequences: safety outputs go low and Recovery is required before operation can resume. These points directly address “what will happen.”
- The answer is concise: one clear sentence answering the question, followed by brief, on-topic supporting points. All content is relevant to the behavior when the stopping time limit is exceeded.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time actual (1000 ms) exceeds the safety limit (200 ms), so a safety limit violation occurs.
- The ground truth states that when this happens, the robot enters recovery mode.
- The student states it is a safety limit violation and adds that Recovery is activated. This matches the ground truth outcome.

Supporting checks:
- Follow the safety/power procedures before re‑powering: power down (press Teach Pendant power), unplug the mains/power cable from the Control Box, allow ~30 s for discharge, check the earth connection, observe ESD precautions and prevent water/dust ingress. [006__L1__6._Assembly__pp38-51.pdf] [015__L1__15._Maintenance_and_Repair__pp192-204.pdf]  
- Perform the Robot Arm Inspection Plan: move the Robot Arm to ZERO (if possible), turn off and disconnect Control Box power, inspect the Robot Cable and its connection, check base mounting bolts and tool flange bolts, and inspect/replace flat rings if worn or damaged. [015__L1__15._Maintenance_and_Repair__pp192-204.pdf]

- The question asks what checks are needed after a modification to the robot arm. This implies post-maintenance/repair verification and safety validation.
- The facts include a “Maintenance and Repair” section that explicitly states: after maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level, adhering to regulations, and the correct functioning of all safety functions must be tested. This directly addresses the question.
- The facts also include “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance,” which discusses testing stop performance and when continuous monitoring might suffice—relevant to post-modification verification.
- The “Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection” and “Inspection Plan” provide concrete post-maintenance inspection steps (e.g., checking cables, mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, flat rings, and a Freedrive hold-position check), which are applicable after making a modification.
- While many other sections (e.g., Program/Installation Manager, Cybersecurity, Assembly, various connection details) are not directly needed to answer the question, the presence of unrelated material is acceptable per the grading criteria as long as some facts are related.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning

- Main claim: The student says post-maintenance checks must verify the correct functioning of all safety functions to ensure the required safety level. This is directly supported: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level. The correct functioning of all safety functions shall also be tested.” The student’s “as required by local/regional safety regulations” also matches the text’s requirement to adhere to valid national or regional work safety regulations.

- Safety/power procedures before re-powering: The student lists powering down via the Teach Pendant power button, unplugging the mains/power cable from the Control Box, allowing ~30 seconds for discharge, checking earth connection, observing ESD precautions, and preventing water/dust ingress. All of these appear in the provided material: power-down sequence with a 30-second discharge, checking the earth connection before re-powering, ESD regulations, and preventing water/dust ingress.

- Robot Arm Inspection Plan: The student cites moving to ZERO if possible, turning off and disconnecting Control Box power, inspecting the robot cable and its connection, checking base mounting bolts and tool flange bolts, and inspecting/replacing flat rings. These steps are explicitly listed in the Robot Arm Inspection Plan.

- Testing stopping performance: The student states to test periodically for degraded stopping times and notes continuous monitoring by the robot when stop time/distance safety functions are the basis of risk reduction. This matches the text: periodic testing is advised unless those specific safety functions are used, in which case no monitoring/testing is required because the robot does continuous monitoring.

- Hallucinations check: The student does not introduce procedures or specifications not present in the facts. All details (including the 30-second discharge, ESD/water/dust cautions, inspection items, and stopping performance notes) are within the provided content.

Conclusion

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the intent of the question: The user wants to know if checks are required after modifying a robot arm, and if so, what checks.
2) Check if the student directly answers this: The student clearly says “Yes” and specifies performing post‑maintenance checks and verifying safety functions. This directly addresses the question.
3) Evaluate helpfulness: The student provides specific follow-up checks (power/safety procedures before re‑powering, inspection plan items, and testing stopping performance and safety functions). These are actionable and pertinent to post‑modification verification.
4) Assess conciseness and relevance: The answer is reasonably concise and focused on post‑modification checks. The listed items are directly related; no off-topic material is included. The level of detail supports the question without being unnecessarily long.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that after a robot arm modification, tests are required, specifically verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing emergency stops, safeguard inputs, mode/reduced-mode indicators, enabling device, relevant outputs, and commissioning requirements.
- The student explicitly confirms that checks are needed and emphasizes verifying all safety functions and stopping performance. This aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on safety function testing (e-stop, safeguard, reduced mode, etc.).
- The student adds extra procedures (power-down, inspection plan, mechanical checks). These do not conflict with the ground truth and are consistent with prudent practice after modifications.
- While the student does not enumerate each specific test (e.g., mode icon change, enabling device), omission is acceptable under the rubric as long as there is no contradiction and the content is factually accurate relative to the ground truth.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is consistent with the ground truth, contains no conflicting statements, and is factually accurate.

The explicit names mentioned are: Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, and Recovery Mode. There is also a reference to High Speed Manual Mode as an option when using Manual mode, and a Reduced speed variation related to Three-Position Enabling Device handling, which affects mode behavior.

- The question asks specifically about “safety modes” of the arm and their names.
- The provided facts include multiple sections that directly reference safety system modes:
  - Safety planes “Modes” explicitly list: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode, with explanations tied to when the safety system is in Normal or Reduced mode.
  - Tool Direction Restriction also lists modes in terms of safety system states: Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced.
  - Recovery Mode is described as a safety-related manual mode triggered when a safety limit is exceeded.
- These references contain the exact keywords “safety,” “mode,” “Normal mode,” and “Reduced mode,” and enumerate named modes relevant to the question.
- Although the facts also include unrelated content (programming, run tab, program nodes, technical specs), criterion (3) allows some unrelated information as long as relevant content is present.

Conclusion: The facts contain clear, direct information about safety modes and their names.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student lists the following modes: Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, High Speed Manual Mode, and mentions a reduced-speed behavior when a Three-Position Enabling Device (3PE) is configured.
- Cross-check with the provided FACTS:
  - Modes section (13.3) explicitly defines Automatic Mode and Manual Mode.
  - It also defines High Speed Manual Mode as available in Manual Mode when a 3PE is configured.
  - Recovery Mode is described in 13.3.1 and is a type of Manual Mode.
  - The reduced-speed behavior with a 3PE is stated: “If a Three-Position Enabling Device is configured, the robot operates at Manual Reduced Speed unless High Speed Manual Mode is activated.”
  - The student references “Safety Plane sections” and “safety modes.” The Safety Planes section (10.4) does define plane Modes (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode). Although the student doesn’t list these, merely noting that safety modes are described there is consistent with the facts.
- No claims contradict the facts, and no content is introduced that lies outside the provided material.
- Minor note: calling Automatic/Manual “safety modes” is slightly imprecise (they are operational modes), but the student also correctly ties reduced speed to 3PE handling and mentions Recovery Mode, which is safety-related. This imprecision does not constitute hallucination or contradiction.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- Rationale: Every mode the student named and the reduced-speed behavior are present in the FACTS, and no information outside the provided scope was introduced.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for a specific count (“How many”) and the exact names of the safety modes.
- The student says “several safety modes” without giving a definite number, so the question’s first requirement (how many) is not answered.
- The names provided (Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, Recovery Mode) appear to be operating modes, not explicitly “safety modes.” The mentions of “High Speed Manual Mode” and “Reduced speed variation” are described as options/variations, not clearly identified as safety modes.
- The answer includes extra contextual information rather than a clear, concise list that directly matches the question’s request.

Conclusion: The response does not provide a clear count and does not definitively list the safety modes by name, so it does not directly or sufficiently answer the question.

Relevance: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are exactly three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- The student claims “several” safety modes and lists Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, and Recovery Mode, plus mentions High Speed Manual Mode and a Reduced speed variation.
- Only Recovery Mode aligns with the ground truth.
- Automatic Mode does not match Normal mode, and Manual Mode does not match Reduced mode.
- The student’s count (“several”) and the named modes do not match the specified three modes and their names in the ground truth.

Conclusion: The student answer is not factually accurate relative to the ground truth.
