1) Identify what the question asks: It wants the number of safety modes the arm has and their names. So any content about “modes” (especially safety-related ones like Normal/Reduced, Recovery, Backdrive, Reduced Mode) is relevant. Operational modes (Manual/Automatic) are also related since they are modes of the arm, though not strictly “safety modes.” Content that only discusses procedures (e.g., E-stop reset) without mentioning modes is less relevant.

2) Scan the provided facts for mode-related content:
- Directly relevant:
  - 13.3. Modes: Describes Manual Mode, Automatic Mode, and High Speed Manual Mode; also discusses Manual Reduced Speed when 3PE is configured.
  - 13.3.1. Recovery Mode: Explicitly named “Recovery Mode,” a type of Manual Mode.
  - 13.3.2. Backdrive: “Backdrive is a Manual Mode…”
  - 10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set: Defines the safety modes “Normal” and “Reduced,” and how Reduced mode is triggered (by plane or input).
  - Safety inputs/outputs sections: Refer to “Reduced Mode,” “Reduced,” “Not Reduced.”
  - 10.4. Software Safety Restrictions (Safety planes): Includes a Modes section (Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode), tying directly to safety mode behavior.

- Partially or not directly relevant (do not specify modes):
  - 13.1. Emergency Stop: E-stop description and reset procedure (focuses on stop categories and procedure, not modes).
  - 13.2. Movement Without Drive Power: Forced back-driving without power (procedure-focused). Note: different from the “Backdrive” Manual Mode described later.

3) Conclusion:
- The facts include multiple sections explicitly about modes, including the safety modes (Normal and Reduced), and other modes (Manual, Automatic, High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode, Backdrive). Therefore, the provided facts contain clear keywords and semantic content directly related to the question.

- The question asks about a specific safety setting: the Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) and what happens if the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop. This is about safety functions and the system’s reaction to exceeding a configured safety limit.
- The provided facts explicitly cover:
  - The Stopping Time Limit safety function: “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
  - How safety functions behave: they monitor limits and “dynamically reduce the speed … such that it can always be stopped within the limits.”
  - The system reaction when a safety limit is exceeded: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and more generally “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- These points directly address what would happen if the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit (i.e., a limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0). Although the facts include additional sections (MODBUS, PROFIsafe, etc.), the presence of the above directly related items makes the facts relevant per the criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The scenario concerns the Stopping Time Limit safety function. The facts state that if a safety limit is exceeded (e.g., stopping time exceeds the configured limit), it is a “Limit Violation.”
- The reactions table specifies that a Limit Violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- The facts further define Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors, matching the student’s description.
- The manual states that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low, which the student correctly included.
- It also states that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted (Recovery is activated), aligning with the student’s “must be restarted afterward” statement.
- The numerical example (200 ms limit vs 1000 ms actual stop) is consistent with a violation and does not introduce information outside the provided facts.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is accurate, grounded in the provided facts, and contains no hallucinated information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a safety stopping-time limit (200 ms) and gives an actual stop time (1000 ms). Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this is a clear limit violation.
- In most safety systems, exceeding the configured stopping-time limit triggers a safety fault and an immediate safe stop. The student states it will detect a violation, perform a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal), require a restart, and set safety outputs low.
- The answer directly addresses “what will happen” by describing the consequence (violation detected, immediate stop, outputs low, restart required). This is relevant and helps answer the question.
- The mention of Stop Category 0 is a specific implementation detail; while likely, it depends on the system. However, it still aligns with the general expected outcome and remains relevant.
- The answer is concise enough; the added citations are not necessary but do not detract significantly from relevance.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth says that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode due to a safety limit violation.
- The student correctly identifies that a safety limit violation occurs (200 ms limit vs. 1000 ms actual).
- However, the student claims the system initiates a Stop Category 0 with immediate power removal and requires a safety restart, which is not stated in the ground truth.
- The ground truth specifies entering recovery mode as the outcome; the student’s described outcome is different and may conflict with that.

1) Identify the core of the QUESTION: The user modified the robot arm and wants to know what checks are needed afterward. Keywords/ideas: “modification,” “afterwards,” “checks/tests,” “safety,” “commissioning.”

2) Scan the FACTS for matching concepts:
- Section 9. Commissioning explicitly states tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and lists specific checks (safety I/O, emergency stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode input, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, outputs). This directly answers the question.
- Section 15. Maintenance and Repair says “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level” and to test all safety functions. This is directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- 15.1 Testing Stopping Performance discusses testing to determine if stopping performance is degraded, which is relevant to safety checks after changes.
- Safety Configuration sections (10.3.x) cover verifying/applying safety settings, Safety Checksum, and modes/limits. While broader, they are semantically related to verifying safety after changes.
- Other parts (Log tab, Program/Installation Manager, Accessing Robot Data) are less direct but still relate to diagnostics/verification and system setup, not wholly unrelated.

3) Conclusion: The FACTS contain multiple direct and semantically related items about checks required after modifications.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The student states that after any modification, commissioning tests must be performed. This aligns with the FACTS, which require conducting the listed tests before first use or after modifications.
- The specific items the student lists (verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing E-stop, safeguard inputs, 3-position enabling device, Reduced mode, and Robot Moving/Not Stopping outputs) are explicitly present in the Commissioning section. While the student does not enumerate every item (e.g., verifying brakes engage when E-stop is pressed, checking the initialization screen change when reduced input is activated, verifying the mode icon change, and ensuring whole system stop when Emergency Stop outputs are used), their use of “etc.” reasonably indicates the rest of the listed checks and does not contradict the FACTS.
- For maintenance/repair, the student says to perform checks to ensure the required safety level and verify correct functioning of all safety functions, following the Service Manual and applicable regulations. This matches the Maintenance and Repair section, which requires post-maintenance safety checks, adherence to national/regional regulations, and following the latest Service Manual.
- No extraneous or contradictory information is introduced. The answer stays within the scope of the provided FACTS.","- The question asks whether any checks are needed after a modification to the robot arm.

- The student lists concrete checks (safety I/O verification, testing E-stop, safeguard inputs, enabling device, Reduced mode, Robot Moving/Not Stopping outputs), which helps the user know what to do.
- The references to the Commissioning and Maintenance/Repair sections are appropriate and support the guidance.
- The answer is concise and stays on topic; mentioning maintenance/repair is adjacent but still relevant to post-change safety verification.

- The student answer affirms that commissioning tests must be performed and correctly names several of the same items: verifying safety I/O, testing E-stop, safeguard inputs, 3-position enabling device, Reduced mode, and Robot Moving/Not Stopping outputs, etc.
- Although the student does not enumerate every single check (e.g., initialization screen change, mode icon change, explicit mention of E-stop outputs stopping the whole system), nothing they state conflicts with the ground truth, and their summary is accurate and aligned.

- The question asks about the safety behavior when the Stopping Time Limit is configured to 200 ms and the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop. Core concepts: “Stopping Time Limit,” exceeding a safety limit, and the system’s reaction to a limit violation.
- The provided facts explicitly cover:
  - Stopping Time Limit: “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
  - How safety functions handle stopping time/distance and dynamic speed reduction to stay within limits.
  - The system reaction to safety limit violations: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” and “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system… then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- These directly map to the question’s scenario (exceeding the 200 ms limit by stopping in 1000 ms), and they describe exactly what will happen (Stop Category 0).

Commissioning: Explicitly states tests to conduct “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” including verifying all safety inputs/outputs, testing e-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode indication, operational mode icon, 3-position enabling device, emergency stop outputs, and safety-related outputs.
  - 15. Maintenance and Repair (Safety for Maintenance): States that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested.
  - 15.1 Testing Stopping Performance: Advises periodic testing of stopping performance (with conditions when continuous monitoring suffices).
  - 13.3.2 Backdrive/Backdrive Inspection: Includes a “MANDATORY ACTION” to test Backdrive mode on all joints and verify safety settings and safety I/O—relevant to post-change verification.
  - 10.3 Software Safety Configuration (password, applying changes, Safety Checksum): Relevant to ensuring safety settings are controlled, applied, and verified after changes; checking the Safety Checksum for unexpected changes is an advisable post-modification check.
  - 4. Risk Assessment: Emphasizes performing/Updating risk assessment and setting proper safety configuration—pertinent after modifications.
- Partially or not directly related facts (contain content not needed for the specific question):
  - Cleaning methods, PPE for grease, and warnings about bleach (15.2) are not checks after modification.
  - Notices about compressed air, routine inspection intervals, and warranty return notes are marginal to the specific post-modification check.
  - Log Tab details, error report saving, and technical support file export are peripheral diagnostics, not required checks.
  - Program and Installation Manager and Accessing Robot Data are largely unrelated to post-modification safety checks.
  - Detailed configuration of Safe Home, Safe Home outputs, mode switching procedures, movement without drive power, and E-stop reset mechanics are mostly general procedures; only the idea of testing E-stop fits the commissioning checks.

Conclusion:
- Because the provided facts include explicit procedures and safety verifications required after modifications (commissioning tests, safety-function checks, stopping performance considerations, safety configuration verification, and risk assessment), they are relevant to the question, even though some sections are unrelated.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states commissioning tests must be performed before first use and after modifications. This matches the facts.
- They list verifying all safety inputs/outputs and that they function as intended, including emergency stop buttons/inputs (robot stops and brakes engage) and safeguard inputs (including safeguard reset if configured). These points align directly with the commissioning checklist.
- They include checking the initialization screen reduced input behavior, mode icon change on PolyScope, and testing the 3-position enabling device enabling reduced-speed motion in manual mode. All are explicitly required in the facts.
- They mention testing systems connected to Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, and Not Reduced Mode outputs to verify changes are detected, which is correct.
- For Emergency Stop outputs, the facts specify pressing the E-stop and verifying a stop of the whole system. The student generally mentions pressing/triggering and verifying outputs are detected by the connected system. While slightly less explicit about “stop of the whole system,” it does not contradict the facts.
- The student does not introduce any information outside the provided facts (no hallucinations). A minor omission is not mentioning “Determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application,” but omission does not make the answer ungrounded.

1) Understand the question: It asks about the outcome when the Stopping Time safety limit is set to 200 ms but the robot actually stops in 1000 ms (i.e., exceeds the configured stopping time limit).

2) Identify keywords/concepts: “Stopping Time safety limit,” “limit exceeded,” “what will happen.”

3) Check the provided facts for these concepts:
- The facts define Stopping Time Limit: “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- They state what happens on safety limit violations: “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … then a Stop Category 0 is initiated” and in the reactions table: “Limit Violation — Stop Category 0.” They also note that safety outputs reset to low on any fault/violation.

4) Determine relevance: The facts directly address the exact safety function (Stopping Time Limit) and explicitly describe the system reaction when such a limit is violated, which is precisely what the question asks.

Conclusion: The facts are directly related to the question.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The manual lists Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function.
- The safety system’s reaction table states that any safety limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0.
- The manual further clarifies that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- Stop Category 0 is defined as an immediate removal of power to the drives.
- Therefore, if the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the robot actually requires 1000 ms to stop, that exceeds the configured limit, constitutes a limit violation, and correctly results in a Stop Category 0.

The student’s answer stays within the provided facts and does not add unsupported claims.","Relevance: True

Reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- The student directly compares the two values and identifies this as a limit violation, which is exactly the key condition.
- They then state the system response: a safety stop with immediate removal of power (Stop Category 0), which answers “what will happen.”
- The answer is concise and focused on the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit, thus helping to answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a safety limit violation: the robot took 1000 ms to stop when the limit was 200 ms.
- The ground truth states that, as a result, the robot arm will enter recovery mode because the safety limits have been violated.
- The student correctly notes that this is a safety limit violation, but claims the system initiates a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal) as the response.
- This differs from the ground truth’s specified outcome (entering recovery mode). The student does not state that the robot will enter recovery mode; instead, they present a different primary action.

1. Identify the core of the question: It asks what happens if the actual robot stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured Stopping Time safety limit (200 ms). Keywords/semantics: “Stopping Time Limit,” “exceed/violate safety limit,” “safety reaction/what happens.”
2. Scan the provided FACTS for those concepts:
   - The FACTS define the Stopping Time Limit safety function and explain its purpose.
   - They state that the safety system monitors whether safety limits are exceeded.
   - They explicitly list the reaction for a “Limit Violation” as “Stop Category 0.”
   - They also say: “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
   - They describe that restricting stopping time affects robot speed to keep within the configured limit.
3. These points directly address the scenario of exceeding the stopping time limit and what the resulting action is.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Is “stopping time” a safety limit?  
Yes. The manual lists Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”

2) What happens when a safety limit is violated?  
The manual states that a limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0. It also states more generally that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

3) Does Stop Category 0 mean immediate removal of power?  
Yes. The Stop Categories table defines Category 0 as stopping the robot by immediate removal of power.

4) Is Recovery activated after a safety limit violation?  
Yes. The manual explains that when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated, the robot performs a Stop Category 0 and Recovery mode is activated.

5) Can programs run in Recovery?  
No. The manual explicitly says you cannot run programs when Recovery is active; you must move the arm back within limits (e.g., via Freedrive or the Move tab) and then restart.

6) Any extraneous or conflicting details?  
No. The student did not introduce information outside the manual’s scope and their statements align with the documented behavior.

Conclusion:  
Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario sets a stopping time limit of 200 ms and reports an actual stop time of 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this is a clear violation of the configured safety limit.
- In many industrial robot safety systems, exceeding a safety limit triggers an immediate safety response. The student specifies Stop Category 0 (power removal), which is a standard immediate stop action for safety limit violations.
- Following such a stop, the system typically enters a recovery state where normal program execution is blocked until the fault is cleared. The student notes Recovery mode activation and that programs cannot run until recovery is cleared, which describes the expected aftermath of the violation.

Evaluation:
- Conciseness and relevance: The answer is concise and directly addresses “what will happen” when the limit is exceeded. The mention of Recovery mode and inability to run programs is relevant. The brief extra detail about recovery handling remains on-topic.
- Helpfulness: It clearly explains the consequence (Stop Category 0 and Recovery), which answers the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which is a clear violation of the safety limit.
- The ground truth states that when safety limits are violated, the robot arm enters recovery mode.
- The student answer states that exceeding the safety limit triggers a Stop Category 0 and activates Recovery mode; also notes that programs cannot run until recovery is cleared.
- This aligns with the ground truth (Recovery mode activation due to safety limit violation) and does not introduce any conflicting statements. The extra detail about Stop Category 0 and program inhibition is consistent and not contradictory.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The FACTS include a “Commissioning” section explicitly stating: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” followed by a detailed checklist (verify safety I/O connections, test safety inputs/outputs, test E-stops, safeguard inputs, mode indicators, enabling device, reduced mode outputs, etc.). This is directly on point.
- Additional sections reinforce post-maintenance/repair checks: “After maintenance and repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level,” including testing all safety functions—clearly relevant.
- Related safety verification topics appear throughout: testing stopping performance, inspection steps (mounting bolts, cables, flat rings), Backdrive inspection, safety modes and limits, safety I/O verification, and risk assessment considerations—each pertains to what to check to ensure safe operation after changes.
- Some content (e.g., payload setup, pose editor, program manager) is less directly about “checks after modification,” but the presence of multiple directly relevant sections satisfies the criterion that any related content makes the facts relevant.

Conclusion:

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The FACTS state that commissioning tests “must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” The student begins by affirming this requirement, which is correct and grounded.
- The student’s checklist mirrors the FACTS’ “9. Commissioning” bullets:
  - Verifying safety inputs/outputs connections: matches FACTS.
  - Testing all connected safety inputs/outputs (including devices common to multiple machines/robots): matches FACTS.
  - Testing emergency stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage: matches FACTS.
  - Testing safeguard inputs and, if configured, safeguard reset: matches FACTS.
  - Activating Reduced input on the initialization screen and verifying the screen change: matches FACTS.
  - Changing operational mode and verifying the mode icon in PolyScope: matches FACTS.
  - Testing the 3-position enabling device enables motion at reduced speed in manual: matches FACTS.
  - If Emergency Stop outputs are used, verifying whole system stop: matches FACTS.
  - Testing systems connected to Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced Mode outputs: matches FACTS.
  - Determining commissioning requirements specific to the application: matches FACTS.
- The student adds a maintenance/repair note: follow the Service Manual and test safety functions to ensure the required safety level after maintenance/repair. This is grounded in “15. Maintenance and Repair,” which explicitly instructs that after maintenance/repair, checks must confirm the required safety level and correct functioning of safety functions, and that work should follow the latest Service Manual.
- No hallucinated procedures or details were introduced (e.g., no extraneous steps like firmware updates or torque calibrations not present in the FACTS). The bracketed file references are extraneous but do not add content beyond the provided FACTS.

2) Scan the FACTS for overlap:
- A full “13.3. Modes” section is present, defining Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, and High Speed Manual Mode, plus how to switch modes and the role of a Three-Position Enabling Device.
- “13.3.1. Recovery Mode” is explicitly defined as a type of Manual Mode used when safety limits are exceeded.
- “13.3.2. Backdrive” is defined as a Manual Mode variant for moving joints without releasing all brakes.
- Multiple sections describe “Reduced mode” (a safety parameter set) and “Normal” vs “Reduced,” including triggers via planes or inputs.
- Safety I/O and Safety Functions sections repeatedly reference modes (Automatic, Manual) and Reduced Mode.
- Additional safety configuration (safety planes, tool direction/position restrictions) references Normal/Reduced modes and how they operate.

3) Determine relevance:
- The FACTS contain extensive, explicit information about modes and safety-related modes/state configurations. Even tangential items (safety I/O, planes, tool restrictions) still reference Normal/Reduced modes, making them semantically related to “safety modes.”

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify relevant facts in the provided manual: Section 10.2.3 (Safety Parameter Set) states the safety system has two configurable safety parameters: Normal and Reduced. It also explains that the Reduced configuration can be activated by either a Trigger Reduced Plane or an external safety input, and that when switching via an input, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limits become active.
- Compare the student’s claims to these facts:
  - “There are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced.” This matches the manual’s “Normal and Reduced” safety parameter sets.
  - “The Reduced configuration is activated either by a Trigger Reduced Plane or by an external safety input; switching between modes can take up to 500 ms for the new limits to become active.” This exactly matches the manual’s description of activation methods and the potential 500 ms delay.
- Check for hallucinations or content outside scope: The student does not introduce any claims not supported by the provided text and does not contradict any of it.

- The provided facts directly cover:
  - The existence and purpose of the Stopping Time Limit safety function.
  - That the safety system monitors safety limits and, upon a limit violation, initiates a Stop Category 0.
  - A general notice stating that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated, and that upon any fault/violation all safety outputs reset to low.
  - The table listing safety functions (including Stopping Time Limit) and their accuracy and PLd Cat 3 performance.
- Therefore, the facts contain specific, directly relevant information to answer what happens when the stopping time exceeds the configured limit.
- The facts also include extraneous content (e.g., MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET setup, Safe Home configuration, passwords), which are not needed to answer the question. However, per the criteria, the presence of any relevant content makes the submission relevant overall.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The facts list Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function. The safety system reacts to any “Limit Violation” with a Stop Category 0.
- The manual defines Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.
- The manual states that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery mode activates and the safety system must be restarted. While Recovery is active, programs cannot run; the arm can only be moved manually via Freedrive or the Move tab.
- Recovery mode uses fixed, non-customizable limits (specific limits for joint speed, tool speed, force, momentum, power). The manual also warns to use caution when moving in Recovery.

Comparison to the student answer:
- The student says exceeding the Stopping Time Limit is treated as a safety limit violation causing Stop Category 0 and activation of Recovery. This matches the facts.

- If Emergency Stop outputs are used, press the E‑Stop push-button and verify the whole system stops: included and matches the facts.
- Test systems connected to Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode outputs to verify output changes are detected: included and matches the facts.
- Determine the commissioning requirements of the application: included and matches the facts.

3) Post-maintenance checks:
- The facts state that after maintenance/repair, checks must ensure the required safety level and correct functioning of all safety functions. The student’s mention of “post‑maintenance safety checks” is consistent with this requirement.

4) Potential extraneous content:
- The student adds “and document” when referring to commissioning requirements. While “document” is not explicitly stated in the facts, it does not contradict them and does not introduce a new technical claim.
- The file-like citations at the end (e.g., “009__L1__…pdf”) are not part of the provided text but serve as source pointers; they do not add technical content beyond the facts.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer accurately reflects the listed commissioning steps and the requirement for post-maintenance safety checks, without introducing conflicting or unsupported technical claims. Any minor additions (e.g., “document”) are non-substantive and do not deviate from the scope.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the core ask: The question seeks whether any checks are required after modifying a robot arm, implying a need for post-modification/commissioning procedures.
- Check if the student answers that directly: The student explicitly says yes and names “commissioning tests and post‑maintenance safety checks,” which addresses the question.
- Assess relevance and focus: The bullet list stays on-topic, detailing safety inputs/outputs, E‑stop, safeguards, reduced mode, enabling device, and safety outputs—each is directly related to post-modification verification.
- Assess conciseness: The answer is concise and structured as a short list of actionable checks without extraneous content. The references are brief and supportive.
- Assess helpfulness: The list provides concrete, practical checks to perform, which clearly helps the user know what to do after a modification. While some items are brand-specific (e.g., PolyScope), they still exemplify the types of checks needed and do not detract from the guidance.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth requires a list of post-modification commissioning/safety tests. The student explicitly says to perform commissioning tests and post-maintenance safety checks, aligning with this.
- Verify safety I/O: Student includes verifying all safety inputs/outputs are correctly connected and functioning, matching the ground truth (including the spirit of testing devices common to multiple machines, though not explicitly named).
- Emergency stop: Student states testing E-stop buttons/inputs to confirm the robot stops and brakes engage, matching the requirement.
- Safeguard inputs and reset: Student includes testing safeguard inputs and the safeguard reset if configured, matching the requirement.
- Initialization screen and reduced input: Student includes checking the initialization screen and reduced mode activation, matching the requirement to verify the screen changes.
- Operational mode icon: Student includes verifying the operational mode icon changes in PolyScope, matching the requirement.
- 3-position enabling device: Student includes testing that the center position enables motion in manual at reduced speed, matching the requirement.
- E-stop outputs and other safety/status outputs: Student includes verifying Emergency Stop outputs and Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced Mode outputs change as intended. While they don’t explicitly restate “verify whole system stops” when E-stop outputs are used, they already covered pressing E-stop and confirming the robot stops and brakes engage; there is no contradiction, and omission is permissible under the grading criteria.
- Commissioning requirements: Student includes determining (and documenting) the commissioning requirements, consistent with the ground truth.

- Identify the student’s claims:
  1) “There are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced.”
  2) “You can set distinct safety limits for each mode and the system can switch between them via trigger planes or safety inputs.”
  3) “The robot adapts to new safety limits within 500 ms when switching modes triggered by an input.”

- Cross-check with the provided FACTS:
  - The Safety Parameter Set section explicitly states the safety system has two configurable sets: Normal and Reduced, and you can set limits for each (Normal and Reduced subsections).
  - It also states the reduced configuration can be activated either by a Trigger Reduced Plane or by an external safety input (Normal and Reduced; Using a plane to trigger…; Using an input to trigger…).
  - For input-triggered switching, the text says up to 500 ms can elapse before new limits become active and that the robot adapts within 500 ms (Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration).

- Check for hallucinations or contradictions:
  - The student’s statements align directly with the manual excerpts.
  - No unsupported claims were added. While the manual includes additional nuances (e.g., a 20 mm zone around trigger planes), the student’s omission of these details does not introduce errors.

- The question asks about a violation of the Stopping Time safety limit: limit set to 200 ms, actual stop took 1000 ms, and asks what will happen.
- The provided facts define Stopping Time Limit as “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The facts also specify the safety system’s reaction to “Limit Violation: Stop Category 0” and note that “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g., … a safety limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.” They further state that when a safety fault/violation occurs, “all safety outputs reset to low.”
- Therefore, the facts directly contain the concepts and keywords needed to determine the outcome in this scenario (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0).

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The facts state that exceeding any configured safety limit is treated as a “Limit Violation” and the reaction is Stop Category 0. This is reinforced in the “Additional Information” notice: if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated. Therefore, if the Stopping Time Limit is violated, Stop Category 0 is the correct reaction.
- The definition of Stop Category 0 in the provided facts is “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors,” which matches the student’s description.
- The facts also state that when a safety limit from the active set is violated, Recovery mode activates. In Recovery, programs cannot run, the arm must be moved back within limits (via Freedrive or Move tab), and fixed recovery limits apply (Joint Speed, Speed, Force, Momentum, Power). Further violations of these recovery limits result in another Stop Category 0. The student’s summary of Recovery aligns with this.

Minor note:
- In Recovery, the documented limits include a generic “Speed Limit 250 mm/s” rather than specifically “Tool Speed.” The student mentions “Tool Speed” among Recovery limits; while tool speed is a general safety limit elsewhere, Recovery lists “Speed Limit” generically. This is a slight imprecision but does not introduce information outside the provided facts.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets up a clear threshold condition: a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms versus an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which is an overrun.
- A safety limit overrun should trigger a defined safety reaction. The student explicitly states that this triggers a Stop Category 0, which directly answers “what will happen.”
- The student adds brief, relevant details: Stop Category 0 involves immediate removal of power, and Recovery mode behavior after the stop. These details are aligned with the scenario and inform what the user can expect next.
- The answer is concise and focused on the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit. The supporting points remain on-topic and do not introduce unrelated information.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is concise, directly addresses the scenario, and provides helpful context about the resulting stop and recovery behavior.

This is a direct match to the question.
- The “15. Maintenance and Repair” section further says that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested—also directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- Related sections on safety configuration (10.3) and risk assessment (4) describe verifying and applying safety settings, password protection, and ensuring changes comply with the integrator’s risk assessment—concepts pertinent when modifications may affect safety.
- Additional items like stopping performance testing, inspection plans, and logging/reporting can be part of verifying correct operation after changes, keeping them contextually relevant.
- Therefore, the provided facts contain clear, specific procedures and concepts about checks required after modifications, making them relevant to the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:

No discrepancies or extra claims were introduced.
- The student’s statement that commissioning tests must be performed after any modification is explicitly supported by the Commissioning description.
- The additional maintenance/repair guidance the student included (isolate power, check earth connection before re-powering, verify safety functions after maintenance) is drawn from the Maintenance and Repair section’s warnings and post-maintenance checks. Although not exhaustive, it is accurate and within scope.
- The student used “3PE” as shorthand for the three-position enabling device, which is consistent with the manual’s terminology elsewhere.

- The question asks specifically for the number of safety modes the arm has and the names of each mode.
- In the provided facts, the section titled “10.3.5. Software SafetyModes” explicitly defines the safety modes: it states the safety system operates in three safety modes and names them as Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- Additional supporting mentions appear elsewhere, e.g., “13.3.1. RecoveryMode” (detailing Recovery Mode), while “13.3. Modes” discusses operational modes (Manual/Automatic), which are related to modes but not specifically “safety modes.” Nonetheless, the direct presence of “Software SafetyModes” confirms relevance to the question.
- Although many other details (safety I/O, planes, tool restrictions) are not needed to answer this question, the inclusion of the clearly labeled safety modes makes the facts relevant per the grading criteria.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the topic and scope
- The student describes “three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.” The FACTS include a section “10.3.5. Software SafetyModes” that explicitly defines these three safety modes, and “13.3.1. RecoveryMode” further details Recovery Mode. So the topic is covered by the provided FACTS.

2) Verify each claim against the FACTS
- “Normal is the default safety mode.” The FACTS state: “Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default.” This matches.
- “Reduced is activated by a Trigger Reduced plane or a configurable input and uses more restrictive limits.” The FACTS state: “Reduced mode is active when the robot TCP is positioned beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane, or when triggered using a configurable input,” and “Reduced mode limits for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode counterparts.” This matches.
- “Recovery mode activates when a safety limit is violated (Stop Category 0); it allows manual movement back within limits under fixed recovery limits.” The FACTS state: “Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,” and “The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.” They also specify that in Recovery you cannot run programs and must manually move the robot (Freedrive or Move tab) within fixed recovery limits (30 °/s joint speed, 250 mm/s speed, etc.). The student’s summary aligns with this.

3) Check for hallucinations or contradictions
- The student does not introduce any terms or behaviors not present in the FACTS. No conflicting statements are present. While the student didn’t mention that programs cannot run in Recovery or that certain limits are disabled in Recovery, omissions do not constitute hallucinations, and the provided statements remain accurate.

- The question asks about a safety “Stopping Time Limit” being set to 200 ms while the robot actually stops in 1000 ms, and what happens in that case. Key concepts: Stopping Time Limit, exceeding a safety limit, and the system’s reaction.
- The provided facts explicitly define the Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The facts also state how the safety system reacts to “Limit Violation” (Stop Category 0) and that “if the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system… then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.” They further explain dynamic speed reduction to keep within stopping limits and what happens in Recovery Mode if limits are violated.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the exact safety function in question and the consequence of exceeding the configured stopping-time limit.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The facts state that a limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0. The student explicitly says a safety limit violation leads to Stop Category 0 and correctly describes it as immediate removal of power, which matches the definition in the Stop Categories table.
- The facts also state that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery is activated. The student says Recovery will be activated, which is consistent.
- Recovery mode limitations given in the facts include: cannot run programs, must move the arm back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab, and fixed limits such as joint speed 30°/s and speed 250 mm/s. The student mentions these points and the example values accurately.
- No information in the student answer contradicts the provided facts or introduces details outside the scope of the facts.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) The question sets a stopping-time limit of 200 ms and reports an actual stop of 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this is clearly a limit exceedance.
2) Exceeding a configured safety limit typically triggers a safety stop/violation and prevents program execution until the system is recovered. The student states it will trigger a Stop Category 0 and that Recovery will be activated, which describes an immediate safety reaction and the need to recover before resuming operation.
3) The answer is concise and focused on the consequence of exceeding the limit, directly addressing “what will happen.”

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Rationale: The student’s answer is concise, directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping-time safety limit, and explains that a safety stop occurs with recovery required, which helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time limit is 200 ms, but the robot stopped in 1000 ms, which is a clear safety limit violation.
- The ground truth states that a safety limit violation causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode.
- The student states that this is a safety limit violation and that Recovery will be activated, which matches the ground truth outcome.
- The student adds that a Stop Category 0 occurs. While this is extra detail not in the ground truth, it does not conflict with the ground truth statement that recovery mode is entered.

- The facts also state the safety system’s reaction to a “Limit Violation” is a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- Additional notes say if the safety system detects a fault or a safety limit violation, a Stop Category 0 is initiated, and all safety outputs reset to low. Recovery mode behavior after limit violations is also described.

- The facts directly address stopping time limit and what happens when a safety limit is exceeded, which matches the question’s scenario. Therefore, they are relevant.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student claims that exceeding a safety limit will initiate a Stop Category 0. In the facts, “Limit Violation” and “Fault Detection” both trigger Stop Category 0, and it is also stated that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated. This directly supports the student’s main statement.
- The student specifies Stop Category 0 as immediate removal of power. The facts define Category 0 as stopping by immediate removal of power, so this is accurate.
- The student uses the Stopping Time Limit as an example of a safety function whose violation would be a “limit violation.” Since any safety limit violation triggers Stop Category 0 per the table, this example is consistent with the facts.
- The student adds that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery mode is activated and the safety system must be restarted. The facts state that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated (and elsewhere that the safety system must be restarted), and that you cannot run programs in Recovery until moving back within limits.

- The question asks what occurs when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured stopping time safety limit (200 ms).
- Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this constitutes an exceeded safety limit.
- Typical safety behavior for exceeding the stopping time limit is to register a safety limit violation and trigger an immediate stop (Stop Category 0), followed by requiring recovery/reset.

1) Interpret the question: The user asks what checks are required after making a modification to the robot arm. So we look for facts about post-modification checks, commissioning, safety verification, inspections, or tests after maintenance/changes.

2) Identify directly relevant facts:
- “9. Commissioning” explicitly states: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” followed by a checklist (verify safety I/O, test E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, mode icon, 3-position enabling device, outputs, etc.). This directly answers the question.
- “15. Maintenance and Repair” says after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure required safety level and to test all safety functions—clearly relevant to post-modification checks.
- “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance” discusses verifying stopping performance—relevant to safety checks after changes.
- “Robot Arm Inspection Plan” (bolts, cables, flat rings) and the inspection steps are pertinent checks after work on the arm.
- “10.3 Software Safety Configuration,” “Safety Checksum,” and related safety configuration sections (modes, limits, safe home) relate to verifying safety settings and changes—relevant after modifications.
- “8.2 Safety I/O” emphasizes verifying and testing safety functions before operation—relevant.

3) Assess any unrelated parts:
- Some details (e.g., Program and Installation Manager, About > robot data, Move/pose editor details) are not directly about post-modification checks, but the facts set still contains numerous items with keywords and semantics directly tied to the question.

  - Verifying safety inputs/outputs connections and proper function, including devices shared across machines/robots.
  - Testing Emergency Stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage.
  - Testing safeguard inputs and safeguard reset (if configured).
  - Observing the initialization screen while activating reduced mode input; changing operational mode and verifying the PolyScope mode icon.
  - Testing the 3-position enabling device for center-on enabling at reduced speed in manual mode.
  - If Emergency Stop outputs are used, pressing E-stop to verify whole-system stop.
  - Verifying safety-related outputs (Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced) change as expected.
- The student also notes that after maintenance/repair, safety checks must be performed and safety functions verified; this matches the Maintenance and Repair guidance that requires post-maintenance checks to ensure the required safety level and testing of all safety functions.
- There is no information introduced that falls outside the provided facts. The student does not contradict the manual. The only minor omission is not explicitly mentioning “Determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application,” but this does not introduce any hallucination or contradiction.

Conclusion: The answer is fully grounded in the provided FACTS and contains no hallucinated information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the user’s need: After a modification to the robot arm, they want to know if any checks are required.
2) Check if the student answers that need directly: The student explicitly says “Yes” and specifies to perform commissioning tests after any modification.
3) Evaluate specificity and usefulness: The student lists concrete, actionable checks (safety I/O verification, E-stop tests, safeguard/reset behavior, mode indication, enabling device, reduced mode, safety-related outputs), which directly guide what to do.
4) Assess concision and relevance: The answer is focused on post-modification checks, uses concise bullet points, and avoids unrelated details. The added note about maintenance/repair checks remains relevant to post-work verification.
5) Determine if it helps answer the question: It not only confirms checks are needed but outlines what to check, making it helpful.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth specifies that after a modification, a set of commissioning/safety tests must be performed.
- The student explicitly states that commissioning tests must be done and provides a checklist.
- The student’s checklist matches each ground-truth item:
  - Verifying all safety inputs/outputs are connected: included.
  - Testing all connected safety inputs/outputs (including shared devices): included.
  - Testing E-stops to ensure robot stops and brakes engage: included.
  - Testing safeguard inputs and safeguard reset (if configured): included.
  - Checking initialization screen behavior when reduced input is activated: included.

1) The question asks specifically about “safety modes” of the arm and their names.
2) In the provided facts, there is a dedicated section “10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set” that explicitly defines the safety parameter sets as “Normal” and “Reduced,” and repeatedly refers to “Reduced mode” and switching between Normal and Reduced. This directly matches “safety modes.”
3) Additional sections discuss modes broadly (Manual, Automatic, High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode, Backdrive) and safety behaviors (e.g., Reduced Mode triggers via safety planes), which, while not all strictly “safety modes,” are semantically related to the concept of modes and safety configuration.
4) Therefore, the facts contain clear, direct references to the safety modes and their names.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Explanation:
- The student claims: “There are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced.”
- In the provided facts, the safety system explicitly has two configurable safety parameter sets: “Normal” and “Reduced,” and multiple features (e.g., safety planes, tool direction limits) can be active in Normal, Reduced, or both. This aligns directly with the student’s statement.
- The student did not introduce any information beyond the facts. Although the manual also defines operational modes (Manual, Automatic, Recovery, Backdrive, etc.), the student’s phrase “safety modes” clearly corresponds to the safety parameter sets “Normal” and “Reduced,” which is accurate.
- Therefore, the answer is grounded in the provided facts and contains no hallucinated content.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two specific things: the number of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student states there are two safety modes and lists them as ""Normal"" and ""Reduced.""
- The answer is concise and directly addresses both parts of the question.
- The trailing bracketed citation text is slightly extraneous but does not detract from the relevance or clarity.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The ground truth says the arm has three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student states there are two safety modes and lists only Normal and Reduced.
- This omits Recovery mode and gives an incorrect count.

- The question is about the “stopping time safety limit” being set to 200 ms and the robot actually stopping in 1000 ms, and asks what will happen. So key concepts are: stopping time limit, exceeding that limit, and the system’s reaction to such a violation.
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated,” which directly matches the question.
- The facts also state how the safety system reacts to violations: “The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded” and under reactions, “Limit Violation – Stop Category 0.” This directly informs what happens if the stopping time exceeds the set limit.
- Additional relevant notes include that stopping time/distance limits are used to ensure the robot can always be stopped within limits and that restricting stopping time affects overall speed, which gives context to the behavior.
- Although the facts include unrelated sections (e.g., MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, PROFIsafe configuration details), the presence of unrelated material does not matter per the criteria as long as any part is related.

  - Move tab/Freedrive warnings: instruct to verify installation settings (mounting angle, payload mass/CoG) before using Freedrive; this is relevant after any physical modification.
  - Mounting orientation snippet: warns to use the correct installation settings and to save/load installation files, which is pertinent after changes.
  - Safety planes, Tool Direction/Position Restrictions: emphasize correct setup of features/TCP and warn about syncing changes and warnings when out of sync—relevant to verifying configurations after modifications.
  - I/O Tab and Tool Communication Interface: describe monitoring live I/O, reserved safety I/Os, and configuration/sync behavior—useful checks after hardware/tooling changes.
  - Modes and Recovery/Backdrive sections: include safety limits and procedures, and warnings about safeguards and mode switching—relevant to safe verification and operation after changes.

- The question asks specifically about the number of safety modes the arm has and their names.
- Within the provided facts, there is a dedicated section titled “Software Safety Modes” that explicitly lists and describes the safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- Additional sections about operational modes (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual) are present, but the “Software Safety Modes” section directly addresses “safety modes,” matching the question’s keywords and intent.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify what the FACTS say about “safety modes.” In section 10.3.5 (Software Safety Modes), the manual explicitly lists three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode.
- Compare to the STUDENT ANSWER. The student states, “There are three safety modes,” which matches the FACTS.
- Check for added or incorrect information. The student does not add any extra claims beyond the count, and the count is correct per the manual.
- Note potential ambiguity with other “modes.” The manual also defines operational modes (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual), but the student’s statement refers to “safety modes,” which aligns with the three in 10.3.5 and does not conflict with operational modes.

- The question asks for two pieces of information: (a) how many safety modes the arm has, and (b) the names of each mode.
- The student’s answer provides only the count (“There are three safety modes”) and does not list any names.
- While the answer is concise and partially relevant (it addresses the number), it does not fulfill the full request because it omits the names.

- The student asserts that commissioning tests must be performed before first use and after modifications. This matches the FACTS under “9. Commissioning.”
- They list verifying all safety inputs/outputs are correctly connected and functioning, including devices common to multiple machines/robots. This directly reflects the first two commissioning bullets.
- They state to test Emergency Stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage, and if Emergency Stop outputs are used, verify the whole system stops. This matches two separate bullets in the FACTS.
- They include testing safeguard inputs (and Safeguard Reset if configured) to verify motion stops and reset works. This aligns with the FACTS.
- They mention checking the initialization screen, activating Reduced input to verify a screen change, and changing operational mode to verify the mode icon in PolyScope changes. This matches the FACTS.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The provided facts include a “Commissioning” section that explicitly states: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and then lists concrete checks (verify all safety I/O connections, test safety inputs/outputs, test emergency stops, safeguard inputs and reset, reduced mode input, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, Emergency Stop outputs, and safety-related outputs). This directly answers the question.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section also states that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that the correct functioning of all safety functions shall be tested—again directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- Additional included sections (e.g., testing stopping performance, inspection plans, safety configuration/change/apply, Safety Checksum) provide related guidance on what to verify after changes and how to confirm safety settings are applied, which is semantically aligned with the question.

- It also lists concrete safety checks (verify safety I/O connections and test their function), which are relevant and useful steps post-modification.
- The response is concise, focused on the asked topic, and provides practical guidance without extraneous detail.

Relevance: True","Correctness: True

Explanation:
- The student acknowledges that checks are required after a modification and refers to performing the commissioning tests listed in the manual, which aligns with the ground truth that there is a list of tests to conduct.
- The student lists two specific checks:
  - Verifying all safety inputs and outputs are correctly connected.
  - Testing all connected safety inputs and outputs, including devices common to multiple machines/robots, to ensure they function as intended.
  These items match entries in the ground truth.
- While the student does not enumerate additional tests (e.g., emergency stop, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, operational mode icon, enabling device, outputs), omission alone is acceptable under the grading criteria as long as there is no contradiction.
- The phrase “select and perform those relevant to your change” does not conflict with the ground truth, which includes determining the commissioning requirements of the application; it does not assert anything false about the required checks.",resp_03a14ab861b1da140068f7900ec4ac819195409937ff240cfb,gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,incomplete,1761054734.0,29175,472,29647

- In the provided facts, there are multiple sections that directly discuss “modes” and, more specifically, “safety modes”:
  - “13.3. Modes” covers Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode, and Backdrive (operational/manual variants).
  - The safety parameter sets explicitly define “Normal” and “Reduced,” with multiple references to “Reduced Mode,” “Not Reduced,” and triggers for Reduced Mode. This is the clearest mapping to “safety modes.”
  - Safety I/O and functions further reference Reduced Mode and Normal/Reduced behaviors (e.g., safety planes modes, safety outputs “Reduced/Not Reduced”).
- These references contain the keywords and semantic content needed to answer how many safety modes there are and what they’re called (Normal and Reduced), and also discuss operational modes which, while broader, are still related to the notion of modes.

- The facts include direct and detailed information about safety modes (Normal and Reduced) and are therefore relevant to the question.

- The provided facts include detailed sections on:
  - Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit as configurable safety functions.
  - The safety system’s reaction when a safety limit is exceeded: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” and that faults/violations trigger a Stop Category 0 and reset safety outputs.
  - The purpose of these functions (dynamically reducing speed to stop within limits) and their accuracy.
  - Recovery mode after a safety limit violation.
- These directly address the semantics of the question (what happens if the stopping time exceeds the configured limit).
- While many other sections (e.g., MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET) are not needed for this question, criterion (3) allows extra information as long as relevant content is present.

Reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual robot stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms).
- The student provided no answer, so it does not address the scenario, provide any explanation, or state the consequence.
- Therefore, it is neither relevant nor helpful in answering the question.

This directly answers the question.
- Additional sections reinforce post-modification checks:
  - Maintenance and Repair: requires safety checks after maintenance/repair and verification of safety functions; warns about power isolation and ESD; emphasizes re-checking safety levels.
  - Testing Stopping Performance: advises periodic testing of stopping performance (relevant to ensuring safety hasn’t degraded after changes).
  - Risk Assessment and Software Safety Configuration: stresses that changes must comply with a risk assessment, be password-protected, applied/restarted, and verified via Safety Checksum—relevant when modifications might affect safety settings.
  - Safety-related Functions and Interfaces, Safety Inputs/Outputs, and Modes/Recovery/Backdrive: provide context on what to test and how the system reacts to safety triggers—useful for post-modification verification.
- Some content (e.g., cleaning agents, grease PPE, Program/Installation Manager details) is less directly tied to “checks after modification,” but the presence of many directly relevant items satisfies the relevance criteria.

- The facts further state that if a safety limit is exceeded (i.e., a “Limit Violation”), the safety system reaction is a Stop Category 0. They also note generally that any safety system fault or limit violation initiates Stop Category 0.
- The facts also explain that these safety functions dynamically reduce speed to ensure the robot can be stopped within configured limits, which is directly related to the scenario in the question.
- While the facts include additional content (e.g., fieldbus/MODBUS/PROFINET/PROFIsafe, passwords), criterion (3) allows some unrelated information as long as relevant content is present, which it clearly is.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The manual states that the safety system monitors safety limits and that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0. Therefore, exceeding the configured Stopping Time Limit qualifies as a limit violation and will initiate a Stop Category 0.
- The description of Stop Category 0 in the provided facts is “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors,” which matches the student’s wording.
- The manual also states that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. This supports the student’s second sentence.
- The student’s mention of “200 ms” appears to be an example of a configured Stopping Time Limit. The manual allows configuring the Stopping Time Limit and even provides an example (300 ms), so using 200 ms as a hypothetical configured value is consistent with the facts and does not change the underlying claim.

Conclusion: The answer accurately reflects the documented behavior (limit violation → Stop Cat 0; outputs reset low). The only specific number (200 ms) is clearly illustrative and within the configurable scope described.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and states the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms, which exceeds the limit.
- A typical safety response to exceeding a stopping time limit is to treat it as a safety violation and trigger an immediate safe stop and fault condition.
- The student’s answer states exactly that: exceeding the limit is a violation, it triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), and sets safety outputs low.
- The answer is concise, directly addresses what will happen, and provides actionable detail consistent with common safety behavior.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario clearly violates the stopping time safety limit (1000 ms actual vs. 200 ms limit).
- The ground truth states that when this limit is violated, the robot enters recovery mode.
- The student answer correctly identifies that this is a safety limit violation, but then specifies the outcome as initiating a Stop Category 0 with safety outputs set low.
- This outcome differs from the ground truth’s specified behavior (“enter recovery mode”). The student answer does not mention recovery mode and instead describes a different response, which is not stated in the ground truth and may conflict with it.

This directly answers the question.
- The “15. Maintenance and Repair” section says that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and to test correct functioning of all safety functions. This is also directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance” discusses testing stop performance periodically and implications if it degrades. While not strictly “after modification,” it is relevant to verifying safety performance.

  • The Modes section explicitly defines two operational modes: Automatic Mode and Manual Mode, selectable via Teach Pendant or Dashboard Server. This confirms claim (1).
  • It further states: “Recovery Mode is automatically activated… Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode.” and “Backdrive is a Manual Mode…” This confirms claim (2).

- Check for overreach/hallucination:
  • The student uses the phrase “operational safety modes,” which is slightly imprecise compared to the manual’s “operational modes,” but the substance matches the facts.
  • No additional unsupported details are introduced.

Conclusion: The answer accurately reflects the manual and does not add unsupported information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks specifically for the number of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student provides a count (two) and names (Manual and Automatic), which are concise.
- However, Manual and Automatic are typically operational modes, not safety modes. The student’s own supporting detail treats Recovery Mode and Backdrive as states within Manual, which suggests a misunderstanding of what constitutes a “safety mode.”
- Because the response classifies operational modes as safety modes and does not enumerate the actual safety modes, it does not effectively answer the question being asked.

Relevance: False","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student claims there are two modes: Manual and Automatic.
- The student further classifies Recovery as a special Manual-mode state, which contradicts the ground truth that lists Recovery as one of the safety modes.
- The number of modes (two vs. three) and the names (Manual/Automatic vs. Normal/Reduced/Recovery) both conflict with the ground truth.

- The question asks about a “stopping time safety limit” set to 200 ms and what happens if the actual stop takes 1000 ms. This hinges on the safety function “Stopping Time Limit” and the system’s reaction to exceeding a configured safety limit.
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as limiting the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated, and note that safety functions dynamically reduce speed so the robot can be stopped within the limits.
- The facts also state multiple times that if a safety limit is exceeded (a “limit violation”), the safety system initiates a Stop Category 0. They further note that when the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low, and recovery is required.
- Although the facts include many additional topics (MODBUS, PROFINET, general safety messages, I/O setup, etc.) that are unrelated to the question, they do contain direct, keyword-matching, and semantically relevant information about “Stopping Time Limit” and “limit violation” reactions.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Rationale: The facts contain direct references to the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and clearly describe the consequence of exceeding a safety limit (Stop Category 0), which is exactly what the question is about.","Step-by-step reasoning:

- The facts define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” If that limit is exceeded, it constitutes a safety limit violation.
- The safety system reactions table states that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0.
- The Stop Categories section defines Category 0 as stopping the robot by immediate removal of power.
- In the student’s scenario, 1000 ms actual stopping time exceeds a configured 200 ms limit, which is indeed a violation of the Stopping Time Limit.
- Therefore, the stated consequence—initiating a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power)—matches the manual.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- The answer is consistent with the provided facts and does not introduce information outside their scope.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and states the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, that is a clear violation of the safety limit.
- The expected consequence of exceeding a safety stopping time limit is that the safety system detects the violation and triggers a safety stop/fault to bring the robot to a safe state.
- The student’s answer states that a violation will be detected and specifies that a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal) will be initiated.
- This directly addresses what will happen: a safety violation leads to an immediate stop. While specifying “Stop Category 0” could depend on the particular system’s implementation, the core outcome (safety violation and immediate stop) is aligned with the question’s intent.

Conciseness and relevance:
- The answer is concise and stays on topic.
- It helps answer the question by explaining the result of exceeding the safety limit.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms with an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which is a clear violation of the safety limit.
- The ground truth specifies that when this safety limit is violated, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- The student correctly notes that a safety violation is detected, but claims the system initiates a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- This outcome (Stop Category 0) does not match the ground truth outcome (entering recovery mode). Therefore, the student’s stated consequence is not aligned with the expected behavior.

- The “Maintenance and Repair” section states that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and all safety functions must be tested—directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- Additional sections (Testing Stopping Performance, Software Safety Configuration, Safety Checksum, Modes/Recovery, Safety-related Functions and Interfaces, Risk Assessment) provide procedures and verifications that might be necessary or prudent after modifications, especially if safety parameters or interfaces were affected.
- Some content (e.g., cleaning agents) is not directly about post-modification checks, but the presence of multiple directly relevant items satisfies the relevance criteria.

1) Understand the question: It asks about the behavior when the Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) is exceeded because the robot actually stopped in 1000 ms. So we need information about the Stopping Time Limit safety function and what happens when a safety limit is violated.

2) Check the provided facts for relevant content:
- The facts define “Stopping Time Limit” and “Stopping Distance Limit” as configurable safety functions that limit maximum stopping time/distance and dynamically reduce speed to ensure compliance.
- The facts explicitly state that “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … or a safety limit is exceeded, then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- The “Safety Functions” reactions table shows “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
- Related notes explain that when safety violations/faults are detected, safety outputs reset to low.
- Additional material about recovery mode and safety modes also ties into what happens after a violation.

3) Note extraneous content: The facts also include PROFINET/MODBUS/PROFIsafe, I/O setup, and other safety functions, which are not needed to answer the question. However, per the grading criteria, their presence does not make the set irrelevant as long as relevant content exists.

Conclusion: The facts directly address the Stopping Time Limit and the system reaction to exceeding it (Stop Category 0), so they are relevant.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the student’s claim: If the Stopping Time Limit is set to 200 ms and the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop, the safety system will detect a violation and initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).
2. Check relevant facts:
   - Stopping Time Limit is a configurable safety function.
   - The safety system monitors safety limits and, upon a limit violation, triggers Stop Category 0.
   - Stop Category 0 is defined as immediate removal of power.
3. Map the scenario to the facts: Taking 1000 ms to stop exceeds a configured 200 ms Stopping Time Limit, which is a “limit violation,” and per the manual, limit violations cause a Stop Category 0.
4. Ensure no extra or conflicting information: The answer does not introduce information outside the provided facts and correctly characterizes Stop Category 0 as immediate power removal.

Conclusion: The student’s answer directly aligns with the documented behavior (limit violation → Stop Category 0) and uses correct terminology about Stop Category 0.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the core of the question: The stopping time limit is 200 ms, but the actual stopping time was 1000 ms; the user asks what happens in this violation scenario.
2. Check if the student’s answer addresses this: The student states that exceeding the limit triggers a safety violation and results in a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).
3. Assess concision and relevance: The answer is concise, directly tied to the question, and explains the consequence clearly.
4. Evaluate helpfulness: It provides a specific outcome (Stop Category 0), which directly answers “what will happen.”

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The ground truth states that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes the robot arm to enter recovery mode due to a safety limit violation.
- The student correctly notes that the stopping time limit is violated (200 ms limit vs. 1000 ms actual).
- However, the student concludes the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), which is not what the ground truth specifies. The ground truth specifically says the robot enters recovery mode.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer conflicts with the ground truth outcome (recovery mode vs. Stop Category 0), even though it correctly identifies a violation.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The facts include a “Commissioning” section explicitly stating tests that must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” including verifying safety I/Os, testing E-stops, safeguard inputs, mode changes, and 3PE device behavior.
- The facts also include “Maintenance and Repair” guidance that after maintenance/repair, checks must ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested.
- Additional related items include verifying safety configuration via the Safety Checksum and ensuring configuration changes comply with the risk assessment.
- While many other sections (e.g., safety planes, tool restrictions, Freedrive) are broader, the presence of the above directly addresses the post-modification checks.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Core claim check:
- Student says commissioning tests must be performed after any modification. The Commissioning section explicitly states tests must be conducted before first use or after making any modifications. This matches the FACTS.

2) Checklist items mapping to FACTS:
- Verify all safety inputs/outputs and devices common to multiple machines/robots: Explicitly listed in the Commissioning checklist.
- Test emergency stop buttons/inputs to verify the robot stops and brakes engage: Explicitly listed. The student also mentions checking reset procedure “if used.” While the Commissioning section does not require an E-stop reset test, the Emergency Stop section details the reset procedure, and Commissioning does require testing safeguard reset if configured. The student also separately lists safeguard reset testing, so this remains within scope and not contradictory.
- Test safeguard inputs and any safeguard reset: Explicitly listed in Commissioning.
- Activate reduced input and verify the initialization screen changes: Explicitly listed in Commissioning.
- Change operational mode and verify the mode icon changes: Explicitly listed in Commissioning.
- Test the Three-Position Enabling Device (3PE) so center position enables motion in Manual at reduced speed: Explicitly listed in Commissioning and consistent with Modes description.
- Verify systems connected to safety-related outputs (Emergency Stop outputs, Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode) detect output changes: Explicitly listed in Commissioning.
- Follow the integrator’s risk assessment and ensure safety settings comply when changing configurations: Explicitly stated in the Software Safety Configuration section.

3) Hallucination check:
- All items are drawn from the provided manual excerpts. No extraneous features or procedures are introduced beyond what is in the FACTS. The mention of E-stop reset procedure is supported by the Emergency Stop section and does not contradict the Commissioning list.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer is fully grounded in the provided FACTS and does not introduce unsupported information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after modifying the robot arm.
- The student explicitly answers “Yes” and specifies that commissioning tests must be performed before use, which directly addresses the question.
- The student provides a concise, targeted checklist of specific checks (safety I/O, E-stops, safeguards, reduced mode, mode icon, enabling device, safety outputs) that are relevant and actionable for post-modification verification.
- They also note following the risk assessment and safety configuration procedures, which is appropriate context for ensuring compliance after changes.
- The answer stays focused on the required checks and avoids unnecessary detail.

Explanation:
- The student correctly states that commissioning tests are required after a modification.
- They cover verifying all safety inputs/outputs and include devices common to multiple machines/robots, matching the ground truth.
- They include testing emergency stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage, which aligns with the ground truth. Mentioning checking the reset procedure (if used) does not conflict.
- They include testing safeguard inputs and any safeguard reset, consistent with the ground truth.
- They include activating the reduced input on the initialization screen and verifying the screen change, as specified.
- They include changing operational mode and verifying the PolyScope mode icon change, as specified.
- They include testing the three-position enabling device to allow reduced-speed motion in manual mode, as specified.
- They include verifying detection of changes on safety-related outputs (Robot Moving, Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced Mode). While they do not explicitly restate “verify whole system stops” when E-stop outputs are used, nothing they state conflicts, and they do test E-stop behavior earlier.
- They add following risk assessment and safety configuration procedures; this is additional but not conflicting with “determine the commissioning requirements.”

- The question asks specifically about “safety modes” of the robot arm and their names. Keywords: “safety,” “modes,” “how many,” “names.”
- In the provided facts, there are multiple sections directly addressing safety modes/configurations:
  - “Safety Parameter Set” explicitly defines two safety configurations/modes: Normal and Reduced, including how Reduced Mode can be triggered and how the system adapts.
  - Safety inputs/outputs reference “Reduced Mode” and “Not Reduced,” reinforcing the Normal/Reduced safety state concept.
  - “Software Safety Restrictions” and “Safety Planes” discuss mode-dependent behavior (Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced Mode) within safety configuration—still semantically tied to safety modes.
- Other sections (Emergency Stop, Modes like Automatic/Manual/High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode, Backdrive) are operational/safety-related behavior and not strictly “safety modes,” but they remain within the safety domain and include the keyword “mode,” so they are not completely unrelated.
- No portions of the facts are about an unrelated domain (e.g., networking, finance, biology); all content concerns robot safety, modes, and configurations.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True
The facts include explicit information about safety modes (Normal and Reduced) and related safety-mode behavior, thus they are relevant to the question.","Grounded: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the student’s claims:
  1) There are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced.
  2) Reduced mode is activated either by crossing a Trigger Reduced Plane or via an external safety input, and the robot adapts to the new limits within up to 500 ms.

- Compare with the provided facts:
  • The Safety Parameter Set explicitly lists two configurations: Normal and Reduced. This matches claim (1).
  • The text states Reduced is active when the tool/end effector is on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced Plane or when externally triggered by a safety input, and that up to 500 ms can elapse before new limit values become active; the robot arm adapts to the new limits within 500 ms. This matches claim (2).

- Check for hallucinations or inaccuracies:
  • The student did not introduce any information not present in the facts.
  • The wording “crosses a Trigger Reduced Plane” is consistent with the described behavior (positioned beyond/on the reduced side).
  • While the student did not mention the 20 mm overlap region near trigger planes or that the 500 ms applies to both directions of switching, omissions do not constitute hallucinations and do not contradict the facts.

Conclusion: The student answer is fully grounded in the provided facts and contains no unsupported information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: the count of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student explicitly states there are two safety modes and names them: Normal and Reduced.
- This directly addresses both parts of the question.
- The additional note about how Reduced mode is activated is extra but still relevant context; it does not detract from conciseness since it’s brief.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.

- In Recovery mode, certain limits (joint position, tool position, tool orientation) are disabled and movement should be performed with caution; Recovery enforces fixed recovery limits (e.g., joint speed 30°/s, speed limit 250 mm/s) [010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf].",010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__02__10.2._Safety-related_Functions_and_Interfaces__pp99-106.pdf;012__L1__12._Communication_Networks__pp171-180.pdf;010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf,0.24953215649714308,0.07407407407407407,0.005328819475080663,"Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens if the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured Stopping Time safety limit (200 ms).
- In the provided facts, “Stopping Time Limit” is explicitly listed as a configurable safety function, and its purpose is to ensure the robot can always be stopped within the set limit.
- The facts also state that if a safety limit is exceeded (a limit violation), the safety system triggers a Stop Category 0. Additionally, they note that when the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.
- These points directly address the scenario in the question (exceeding the stopping time limit), describing exactly what will happen.
- Although the facts include other topics (e.g., MODBUS, PROFINET), the presence of clearly relevant safety-limit and reaction information satisfies the relevance criteria.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Main claim: “The robot will register a safety limit violation and perform a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power to the arm/motors).”
- This matches the facts. The manual states that a limit violation triggers Stop Category 0, and Stop Cat. 0 is defined as a hard stop with immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.

2) Recovery behavior after violation:
- The student states that when a safety limit is violated, the system enters Recovery, you must restart the safety system before running programs, and you can move the arm manually (Freedrive or Move tab) to return within limits.
- This is directly supported: the manual says that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted; programs cannot run during Recovery; the arm can be moved manually via Freedrive or the Move tab to return within limits.

3) Recovery mode limits and cautions:
- The student notes that in Recovery mode, limits for joint position, tool position, and tool orientation are disabled and movement should be done with caution; also cites specific fixed recovery limits (e.g., joint speed 30°/s, speed 250 mm/s).
- This aligns with the manual’s warning that those limits are disabled in Recovery and lists fixed Recovery limits including joint speed 30°/s and speed 250 mm/s (along with others like force, momentum, power).

4) Hallucinations check:
- All statements and numerical values given are present in the provided facts. No extra, unsupported claims are introduced.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided facts and does not introduce information outside their scope.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time limit (200 ms) and states the actual stop took longer (1000 ms). That clearly indicates the limit was exceeded.
- Exceeding a safety stopping-time limit typically triggers a safety limit violation and a safety stop/fault, leading to a latched state that requires recovery procedures.
- The student states that a safety limit violation will occur and describes the stop as Category 0 (immediate power removal), which aligns with common safety behavior for such violations.
- The added notes about entering Recovery, needing to restart the safety system, and the constrained movement during Recovery are directly relevant to “what will happen” after the violation and help the user understand next steps.

Conciseness and relevance:
- The main answer is concise and directly addresses the question.
- The extra bullet points are still relevant and helpful, not excessive.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time exceeded the safety limit (1000 ms > 200 ms), so a safety limit violation occurs.
- The ground truth states that when the safety limit is violated, the robot enters Recovery mode.
- The student states there will be a safety limit violation and adds that a Stop Category 0 will occur, then notes the system enters Recovery and requires a restart, with details about Recovery limits.
- These additions do not contradict the ground truth and are consistent with the outcome (entering Recovery due to a safety violation).

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- In the provided facts, Section 9 Commissioning explicitly states tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and then lists concrete checks (verify safety I/O connections, test E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode input, operational mode icon, 3-position enabling device, Emergency Stop outputs, and safety-related outputs). This directly answers the question.
- The Maintenance and Repair section also says that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested. This is directly relevant to “checks afterwards.”
- Additional sections touch on related safety verification and configuration (e.g., Safety Configuration, applying and confirming changes, Safety Checksum), as well as inspection plans and stopping performance testing. While some of these are more general or periodic, they are still semantically related to verifying safe operation after changes.
- Some content (cleaning agents, Program/Installation Manager, Log tab details, Safe Home setup) is not directly about post-modification checks. However, per the criteria, the presence of strongly relevant material means the facts set is still relevant overall.

Conclusion:
- The facts contain explicit instructions about checks to perform after modifications and are therefore relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the student’s main claims:
- After any modification, perform commissioning tests.
- Verify and test all safety inputs/outputs (including devices common to multiple machines), emergency stops, safeguard inputs, 3-position enabling device, reduced-mode indication, operational mode icon, and relevant system outputs (Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced Mode).
- After maintenance/repair, perform safety checks per regulations and follow Service Manual procedures.

2) Compare each claim to the provided facts:
- Commissioning required before first use or after modifications: explicitly stated in 9. Commissioning.
- Verify all safety I/O connections and test all connected safety I/O, including devices common to multiple machines/robots: matches Commissioning bullets.
- Test emergency stop buttons and inputs to verify robot stops and brakes engage: directly matches Commissioning.
- Test safeguard inputs to verify robot motion stops and check safeguard reset if configured: matches Commissioning.
- Look at initialization screen, activate reduced input and verify screen changes; change operational mode to verify mode icon changes: matches Commissioning.
- Test the 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual enabling: matches Commissioning.
- If Emergency Stop outputs are used, verify whole system stops; test outputs (Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced Mode): matches Commissioning.
- After maintenance/repair, perform checks to ensure required safety level, adhere to national/regional regulations, and ensure correct functioning of safety functions; conduct maintenance/inspection per latest Service Manual: all stated in 15. Maintenance and Repair.

3) Check for hallucinations:
- The student does not introduce procedures or requirements not present in the facts. Their bullet points are paraphrases of listed items.
- References to following Service Manual procedures are explicitly supported in the facts.

4) Note minor nuance:
- The facts specifically mention brakes engaging in the emergency stop test. For safeguard inputs, the facts only require that motion stops. The student’s phrasing could be read as associating brake engagement with both, but it does not explicitly claim that brakes engage during safeguard stops. This is a minor ambiguity, not a contradiction.

- The student answer affirms commissioning/post-maintenance checks and lists actions that align with these requirements: verifying safety I/O (including shared devices), testing E-stops with brakes engagement, testing safeguard inputs, checking reduced-mode indication and mode icon changes, testing the 3-position enabling device, verifying E-stop outputs and system outputs, and referencing commissioning/post-maintenance procedures.
- There are no conflicting statements. The student’s additional note about following regulations/service manual is consistent with the ground truth.

Reasoning:
- The student claims there are two safety modes, Normal and Reduced, and that these can be configured as part of the robot’s safety parameter set. The manual explicitly lists “Normal” and “Reduced” as the two safety parameter sets (10.2.3 Safety Parameter Set), and elsewhere refers to “Reduced mode” and “Normal mode” in the context of safety limits, so this terminology is consistent.
- The student states that Reduced becomes active when triggered by a Trigger Reduced Plane or an external safety input, with up to 500 ms transition. The manual confirms both activation mechanisms and specifies “up to 500 ms” for the limits to become active when using an input (10.2.3).

- The question asks about what happens when the Stopping Time safety limit (set to 200 ms) is exceeded (actual stop took 1000 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as limiting the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated.
- The facts also state the safety system’s reaction to a “Limit Violation” is “Stop Category 0,” and further note that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and safety outputs reset to low.
- These points directly address the scenario in the question (exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit) and describe the resulting behavior.
- While many additional sections (e.g., MODBUS, PROFINET/PROFIsafe, OSSD signals) are not needed to answer this specific question, they do not negate the presence of the clearly relevant safety-limit and stop-reaction information.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- The facts contain direct, keyword-aligned information (Stopping Time Limit; limit violation; Stop Category 0) that answers what happens when the stopping time exceeds the configured limit.","Grounded: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student claims that a safety limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0 with immediate removal of power. This matches the provided facts: the safety system reactions table states “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0,” and the PROFIsafe status description defines Stop Category 0 as “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors.”
- The student cites Stopping Time Limit as an example of a safety limit. This is valid because Stopping Time Limit is listed among the configurable safety functions, so exceeding it is indeed a safety limit violation.
- The student adds that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery is activated, programs cannot run, and the arm can be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. This aligns with the Recovery/Recovery Mode descriptions, which state you cannot run programs during Recovery and you can move the arm back within limits via Freedrive or the Move tab.
- No claims extend beyond the provided manual excerpts, and no contradictory or speculative information is introduced.

Conclusion: The answer is fully grounded in the provided facts and contains no hallucinated information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) and gives an actual stopping time (1000 ms), which clearly exceeds the limit.
- Exceeding a configured safety limit constitutes a safety violation; the expected outcome is that the safety system intervenes.
- The student explicitly states the system will treat this as a safety limit violation and initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal), which directly addresses “what will happen.”
- The supporting points further clarify the post-violation behavior (recovery required, limited motion until cleared), which aligns with typical safety response and helps answer the practical implication of “what will happen.”

Conclusion:
- The answer is concise and directly relevant to the question.
- It helps answer the question by describing the immediate system response and the recovery implications.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time limit set to 200 ms with an actual stop of 1000 ms, which is a safety limit violation.
- The ground truth states that violating the safety limit causes the robot to enter recovery mode.
- The student states that a safety limit violation occurs and adds that it triggers a Stop Category 0, and in the supporting points explicitly notes that Recovery is activated and operation is blocked until recovery is cleared.
- This aligns with the ground truth (entering recovery after a safety limit violation). The added detail about Stop Category 0 does not conflict with the ground truth.

- The QUESTION asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm. So anything about commissioning after changes, safety verification, testing safety inputs/outputs, E‑stop tests, safeguard tests, mode checks, enabling device checks, reduced mode checks, outputs verification, and post-maintenance safety checks is directly relevant.
- The FACTS include a “Commissioning” section that explicitly states tests to perform “before first use or after making any modifications,” listing concrete checks (safety I/O, E‑stops, safeguards, reduced mode, mode icon, 3‑position enabling device, safety outputs). This is highly relevant.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section states that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions must be tested. Also relevant.
- Safety-related functions/interfaces, safety inputs/outputs, software safety configuration, modes, and recovery provide background on what to test and how those systems behave; these are relevant because the commissioning checklist includes testing these items.
- Inspection plan and torque/bolt/cable checks (mounting bolts, tool flange bolts, cables, flat rings) describe inspections that could be prudent after a modification; relevant.
- Testing stopping performance is about verifying stop performance; could be part of post-modification verification depending on what was changed; relevant.
- Log tab and error report/export can help verify system state and analyze issues during/after tests; tangential but still supportive of checks; acceptable as relevant.

Facts that are completely unrelated to the QUESTION:
- Detailed cleaning methods, agents, and grease PPE warnings (15.2 Robot Arm Cleaning and Inspection) are about cleaning and handling grease, not about checks after a modification.
- “Movement Without Drive Power” (forced back-driving) is an emergency procedure, not a post‑modification check.
- Program and Installation Manager (creating/opening/saving programs/installations) and “Accessing Robot Data” Legal/Version info are about file handling and software metadata, not checks after modification.

Conclusion:
- The FACTS contain multiple sections directly addressing the exact question (commissioning after modifications, post-maintenance safety checks, and specific tests to perform). Therefore they are relevant overall, with a few clearly unrelated cleaning, emergency movement, and file management details identified above.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states commissioning tests must be performed “for first-time use or after any modifications.” This directly matches the Commissioning description in the FACTS.
- They list verifying safety inputs/outputs and confirming devices common to multiple machines/robots function as intended. This aligns with the first two Commissioning bullets.
- They include testing emergency stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage, and testing safeguard inputs so motion stops. Both are explicitly in the Commissioning bullets. They did not mention checking Safeguard Reset if configured, which is a minor omission but not a hallucination.
- They note checking the initialization screen by activating the reduced input to verify a screen change, and changing operational mode to verify the PolyScope mode icon updates. Both are in the Commissioning bullets.
- They include testing the 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual enabling, matching the Commissioning bullet.
- They cover pressing the Emergency Stop and verifying a system stop if Emergency Stop outputs are used, consistent with the Commissioning list.
- They mention verifying output changes for Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, and Not Reduced Mode, again matching the Commissioning list.
- They did not add information outside the provided FACTS and did not contradict anything. The only notable omissions are the explicit check of Safeguard Reset (if configured) and the directive to “determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application.” These omissions do not introduce hallucinations.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states there are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery. The facts explicitly list these three modes under Software Safety Modes, noting Normal is default, Reduced is triggered by planes or inputs, and Recovery activates after a safety limit violation.
- Normal mode: The student says it is the default active safety mode. The facts confirm “Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default.”
- Reduced mode: The student says it is activated by a Trigger Reduced plane or a configurable safety input and uses more restrictive limits. The facts state Reduced mode is active when the TCP is beyond a Trigger Reduced plane or when triggered via a configurable input, and reduced limits (e.g., speed/momentum) must be more restrictive than normal.
- Recovery mode: The student says it is entered when a safety limit is violated (Stop Category 0), allows limited manual movement to return within limits, and programs cannot run. The facts state that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated; limit violations cause a Stop Category 0; programs cannot run in Recovery; and the arm can be moved (e.g., via Freedrive or Move tab) to get back within limits.

  - The safety system’s reactions table stating that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0.
  - A notice that if the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g., safety limit exceeded), a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
  - Recovery mode notes also reiterate Stop Category 0 on violations.
- These points directly address what happens when the stopping time exceeds the configured limit, which is exactly the scenario in the question.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the student’s claims
- Exceeding the Stopping Time Limit is treated as a safety limit violation.
- The reaction is a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).
- Recovery mode is then activated; programs cannot run during Recovery.
- The arm can be moved back within limits via Freedrive or the Move tab.
- The safety system must be restarted.
- Recovery mode enforces fixed limits (e.g., joint speed 30°/s, speed 250 mm/s, force 100 N, etc.).

2) Check each claim against the provided facts
- Limit violation reaction: The facts state “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” (10.2.2 Safety Functions), and Stop Category 0 is “immediate removal of power” (3.5 Stop Categories). This matches the student answer.
- Recovery mode activation: The facts state “When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery is activated” and “You cannot run programs… the arm can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive or Move tab” (10.2.3 Recovery; 13.3.1 Recovery Mode). This matches the student answer.
- Need to restart safety system: The facts state “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted” (10.2.3 Recovery). Matches.
- Recovery limits: The facts list fixed Recovery limits: Joint Speed 30°/s; Speed 250 mm/s; Force 100 N; Momentum 10 kg m/s; Power 80 W (10.2.3 and 13.3.1). The student cites representative examples consistent with these values.

3) Check for hallucinations or contradictions
- All elements cited are present in the provided text. No extraneous or conflicting information is introduced.
- Minor wording nuance: the student says “tool speed 250 mm/s,” while the manual lists “Speed Limit 250 mm/s” in Recovery; however, the value and implication are consistent and not misleading.

Conclusion:
Grounded: True

The student’s answer accurately reflects the manual: a Stopping Time Limit violation is a safety limit violation leading to Stop Category 0, Recovery mode activation with program execution disabled, movement back within limits via Freedrive or Move tab, requirement to restart the safety system, and adherence to the specified Recovery limits. No hallucinated information was introduced.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) and gives an actual stop time (1000 ms). Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, this constitutes a safety violation and the robot should trigger a safety stop and require a recovery/reset procedure.
- The student’s answer states that this is treated as a violation, that a stop is initiated, and that Recovery mode is activated with restrictions until the safety system is restarted. This directly addresses what will happen.
- The answer includes extra specifics (Stop Category 0, detailed speed/force limits, document references) that aren’t necessary to answer the question and may be more detailed than needed. However, the core outcome—safety violation leading to a stopped robot and recovery/reset—matches the expected result and helps answer the question.

- The question asks what checks are needed after a modification to the robot arm.
- The provided facts explicitly include a “Commissioning” section that states tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and then lists concrete checks (safety I/O, E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, mode icon, 3-position enabling device, safety outputs like Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode, etc.). This directly answers the question.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section adds that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested, which is also directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- Additional sections that support or relate to such checks include: testing stopping performance, verifying safety configuration/changes and Safety Checksum, mode switching behavior and 3PE use in Manual mode, safety inputs/outputs behavior, and recovery/backdrive inspection notes that require verifying safety settings and safety I/O.
- Some content is unrelated to the specific question (e.g., detailed cleaning agents and grease PPE, Program and Installation Manager file operations, About/robot data screens, detailed safety plane/color-code setup steps, tool direction/position restriction configuration details, movement without drive power procedures).

Relevant elements:
- Commissioning checks required after modifications (safety I/O, E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode activation, mode icon, 3PE device, safety outputs).
- Post-maintenance/repair requirement to test safety functions and ensure safety level.
- Testing stopping performance guidance.
- Safety configuration access/locking, applying changes, and Safety Checksum verification.
- Mode switching behavior and 3PE requirements in Manual/High Speed Manual.
- Safety inputs/outputs descriptions (Emergency Stop, Safeguard Stop, Reduced Mode, Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, etc.).
- Backdrive inspection note to verify safety settings and safety I/O.

Completely unrelated elements:
- Cleaning methods/agents and grease PPE warnings.
- Electricity hazard warning about disassembling the power supply timing.
- Program and Installation Manager (New/Open/Save) workflows.
- About menu (General/Version/Legal) data display.
- Detailed setup/how-to for safety planes, color codes, tool direction restriction, tool position restriction.
- Movement without drive power (forced back-driving) emergency procedure.

Conclusion:
- Because the facts include explicit post-modification commissioning checks and related safety verification procedures, they are relevant to the question even though they also contain unrelated material.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states commissioning tests must be performed after any modification. This matches the Commissioning section, which requires tests before first use and after modifications.
- Verify and test all safety inputs/outputs, including those shared with other machines/robots. This is explicitly listed in the Commissioning bullets.
- Test emergency stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage. This is in Commissioning. The note to reset only after visually assessing the cause is consistent with the Emergency Stop procedure in the Emergency Events section.
- Test safeguard inputs and, if configured, safeguard reset. This is in the Commissioning list.
- Check initialization behavior by activating reduced input and verifying the screen changes, and change operational mode to verify the mode icon in PolyScope. Both are in the Commissioning bullets.
- Test the 3‑position enabling device for center-on enabling in manual mode at reduced speed. This is in the Commissioning bullets.
- Verify Emergency Stop outputs and safety outputs such as Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced behave as intended. This aligns with the Commissioning bullet that calls for testing these outputs if used.
- After maintenance/repair, perform checks to ensure required safety level and correct functioning of safety functions per Service Manual/local regulations. This is grounded in the Maintenance and Repair “Safety for Maintenance” section.
- Stopping performance: The student says to periodically test stopping performance if the modification affects it. The Maintenance section says to test periodically to detect degradation, with the exception that if Stopping Time/Distance Limit safety functions are used as the basis for risk reduction, no periodic testing is required because the robot monitors continuously. The student’s statement is somewhat narrower but still within the scope of the manual and not contradictory.

Conclusion:
- The answer stays within the provided FACTS and does not introduce unsupported claims. All listed checks map directly to the manual’s Commissioning and Maintenance sections, with only a minor nuance on stopping performance that remains grounded.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Determine the question’s intent: The user asks whether any checks are required after modifying a robot arm.
2. Check if the student directly answers this: The student explicitly says yes—commissioning tests are required after any modification—addressing the core question.
3. Evaluate helpfulness: The student provides a focused, actionable list of specific checks (safety I/O, emergency stop, safeguards, initialization behavior, mode changes, enabling device, relevant outputs, and stopping performance). These are precisely the kinds of verifications expected after modifications, especially for safety and functionality.
4. Assess concision and relevance: The response is a concise bullet list, all items directly relate to post-modification checks. No extraneous information is included. References support the guidance without distracting.

Conclusion: The answer is both concise/relevant and helps answer the question with practical steps.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that after modifying the robot arm, a series of commissioning checks must be performed, listing specific items: verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing all safety I/O (including shared devices), testing E-stops (robot stops and brakes engage), testing safeguard inputs and safeguard reset, checking the initialization screen change when reduced input is activated, verifying mode icon changes in PolyScope when operational mode is changed, testing the 3-position enabling device in manual mode at reduced speed, testing Emergency Stop outputs (if used) to ensure whole system stops, verifying systems connected to Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced outputs detect changes, and determining commissioning requirements.
- The student answer affirms that commissioning tests are required and enumerates checks matching those in the ground truth:
  - Safety inputs/outputs verification and function checks (including shared devices) — matches.
  - E-stop tests with brakes engaging — matches; added caution about resetting after visual assessment is extra but not conflicting.
  - Safeguard inputs and safeguard reset (if configured) — matches.
  - Initialization screen behavior with reduced input and mode icon change in PolyScope — matches.
  - 3-position enabling device behavior in manual mode at reduced speed — matches.
  - Tests for Emergency Stop outputs and Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced outputs — matches.
- The student also adds general maintenance/repair and stopping performance checks, which are additional and do not contradict the ground truth.
- There are no conflicting statements.

- The question asks specifically about the robot’s safety modes: how many there are and their names.
- The provided facts include a dedicated section “10.3.5. Software SafetyModes” that explicitly defines the safety modes and names them (Normal mode, Reduced mode, Recovery mode). This directly answers the question.
- Additional supporting references appear elsewhere: “13.3.1. RecoveryMode” elaborates on one of the safety modes; several other sections reference “Reduced mode” and safety-state behavior. While sections like “13.3. Modes” discuss operational modes (Manual/Automatic) rather than safety modes, the presence of explicit safety-mode content makes the facts relevant.
- Although many other details (I/O, PROFIsafe, safety planes, etc.) are not necessary to answer the question, they are still within the safety domain and do not render the facts unrelated.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- Claim: “There are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.” This matches the manual’s Software Safety Modes section, which explicitly lists Normal, Reduced, and Recovery as the safety modes.
- Claim: “Normal is the default safety mode.” The manual states Normal mode is active by default under normal conditions.
- Claim: “Reduced is activated by a Trigger Reduced plane or a configured safety input and applies more restrictive limits.” The manual states Reduced mode becomes active when the TCP is beyond a Trigger Reduced plane or when triggered by a configurable input, and that Reduced mode limits for tool and joints must be more restrictive than Normal.
- Claim: “Recovery is entered when a safety limit is violated; it allows manual movement back within limits but disables certain limits.” The manual states Recovery activates when a safety limit is violated, you cannot run programs, and you must manually move the robot back within limits (via Freedrive or Move tab). It also notes that in Recovery, limits for joint position, tool position, and tool orientation are disabled.

No hallucinations:

- The question asks about exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) when the robot actually stops in 1000 ms.
- From the provided facts:
  - “Stopping Time Limit: Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
  - “The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded…”
  - “Trigger → Reaction: Limit Violation → Stop Category 0”
  - “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.”
- Therefore, if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured limit (200 ms), it is a safety limit violation and the robot will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), and safety outputs will reset to low.

Unrelated facts in the provided set:
- Detailed Fieldbus configuration sections (MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET setup) are not needed to answer this specific stopping-time question.
- Much of the I/O setup for program start/stop actions, and general communications statistics, are not required for this question.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- The facts contain the specific safety function (Stopping Time Limit) and the defined reaction to limit violations (Stop Category 0), directly answering what happens when the stop time exceeds the set limit.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the relevant safety reaction for limit violations: The facts explicitly state that a “Limit Violation” results in a Stop Category 0. Therefore, exceeding any configured safety limit (including Stopping Time Limit) is treated as a limit violation and triggers Stop Category 0.

2) Confirm what Stop Category 0 means: The facts define Stop Category 0 as immediate removal of power to stop the robot, which aligns with the student’s phrasing.

3) Determine what happens after a safety limit is exceeded: The facts state that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is activated (or, at minimum, the safety system must be restarted and recovery is used to move the arm back within limits). In Recovery Mode, programs cannot run, and the arm must be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab before resuming. This matches the student’s supporting point.

4) Check for extraneous or inaccurate claims: The student does not introduce claims outside the provided facts. The statements about Stop Category 0 and Recovery Mode behavior are both directly supported.

Conclusion:
- Grounded: True
- Rationale: The student’s answer correctly states that violating the Stopping Time Limit triggers a Stop Category 0 and accurately describes the subsequent Recovery Mode behavior without adding unsupported information.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) and an actual stopping time (1000 ms). This clearly indicates the limit is exceeded.
- The core expected outcome is what the safety system does when a stopping time limit is violated.
- The student states that a Stopping Time Limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), which directly addresses “what will happen.”
- The student also adds brief, relevant follow-up effects (Recovery mode, need to restart safety and move the arm within limits), which helps explain the practical consequence after the violation.
- The answer is concise and directly tied to the question, with minimal but useful context.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes exceeding the stopping time safety limit (1000 ms > 200 ms), which constitutes a safety limit violation.
- The ground truth states that when safety limits are violated, the robot enters recovery mode.
- The student states that a Stopping Time Limit violation triggers Stop Category 0 and also notes that when a safety limit is violated the robot enters Recovery mode and requires recovery actions.
- These statements are not conflicting; Stop Category 0 can be the immediate stop response, after which the system is in a state requiring recovery. This aligns with the ground truth’s outcome (entering recovery mode due to a safety violation).

- The question asks specifically about “safety modes,” how many there are, and their names.
- In the provided facts, section 10.2.3 “Safety Parameter Set” explicitly states the safety system has two configurable safety parameter sets: Normal and Reduced. Multiple places also reference “Reduced mode” and “Normal mode” (e.g., safety inputs/outputs, safety planes modes).
- While other parts discuss operational modes (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual), recovery, and backdrive, the facts still directly contain the exact safety modes information needed to answer the question.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states there are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced. The facts (Safety Parameter Set) explicitly list “Normal” and “Reduced” as the two configurable safety parameter sets, so this is correct.
- The student says Reduced mode becomes active when the tool/end effector is beyond a Trigger Reduced Plane or when an external safety input triggers it. The facts confirm both activation methods for the reduced configuration, so this is correct.
- The student notes that when switching between Normal and Reduced, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limits become active. The facts explicitly state this delay when switching via a safety input, so this is correct.

No information is introduced that is outside the provided facts, and each claim is supported by the text. While the student did not mention the 20 mm overlap zone around trigger planes, omission of extra detail does not conflict with the facts.

Grounded: True","Relevance: True

Reasoning:
- The question asks for two things: the number of safety modes and the names of each.
- The student's first sentence directly provides both: “There are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced.”
- The additional bullet points are related context about how the modes function and switching behavior. While not required, they remain on-topic and do not detract from the answer’s clarity.
- Overall, the response is concise enough and directly helps answer the question.","Correctness: False

Explanation:
- The question asks for the number of safety modes and their names.
- The ground truth specifies three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery.
- The student states there are two safety modes: Normal and Reduced, omitting Recovery and explicitly asserting only two modes.
- Therefore, the student’s answer is factually incorrect relative to the ground truth, despite the additional details about mode behavior and switching.",resp_0cd30346454ac58a0068f79d112d1881908e3c349f150c5fcc,gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,completed,1761058065.0,10525,901,11426

- The question asks about exceeding a configured Stopping Time Limit (set to 200 ms) when the actual stop takes 1000 ms, and what the consequence is.
- The provided facts explicitly define “Stopping Time Limit” as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated.
- The facts also state the safety system reaction to a limit violation: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0,” and elsewhere note that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated and safety outputs reset to low.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the scenario in the question (exceeding the stopping time limit) and the system’s response.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the student’s claims:
- Main claim: If a safety limit is violated, the robot initiates a Stop Category 0.
- Supporting details: All safety outputs reset to low on such a violation; after a limit violation, Recovery is required, programs cannot run during Recovery, and the arm can be moved back within limits via Freedrive or Move tab.

2) Check against the provided facts:
- Stop category on limit violation: The manual explicitly states in “Safety Functions” that a Limit Violation results in Stop Category 0. It also states earlier that a fault or violation in the safety system triggers a Stop Category 0.
- Safety outputs on fault/violation: The manual states, “If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.”
- Recovery behavior after limit violation: The manual’s Recovery section says that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted (Recovery). It also states you cannot run programs during Recovery, but you can manually move the arm back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. It further adds that violations of the Recovery limits result in a Stop Category 0.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope info:
- The student’s example of “e.g., the Stopping Time Limit” being a safety limit is consistent with the listed safety functions (Stopping Time Limit is included). No extraneous standards, numbers, or behaviors beyond what’s in the facts are introduced.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer is fully supported by the provided facts and does not introduce unsupported information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time safety limit is 200 ms, while the actual stopping time is 1000 ms. Since 1000 ms > 200 ms, the limit is exceeded.
- Per the cited safety function behavior, exceeding the Stopping Time Limit constitutes a safety limit violation.
- The documented response to such a violation is a Stop Category 0 with all safety outputs set low, followed by the need for a safety recovery before normal operation can resume.

Assessment:
- Concise and relevant: Yes. The student directly states the violation and the resulting Stop Category 0, which answers “what will happen.”
- Helps answer the question: Yes. It identifies the consequence and aligns with the referenced behavior.

Relevance: True","Correctness: True

Explanation:
- The scenario violates the stopping time safety limit (actual 1000 ms > limit 200 ms), which triggers the robot’s safety system.
- The ground truth states the robot enters recovery mode due to the safety limit violation.
- The student states a safety limit violation occurs and a Stop Category 0 is initiated, and in the supporting points notes that recovery is required afterward.
- These details are consistent with the ground truth: a limit violation leads to a safety stop and then recovery. There are no conflicting statements.",resp_00e366d0c6f412170068f79d50089c81a09e3470b9382a7cc4,gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,completed,1761058128.0,11597,926,12523
