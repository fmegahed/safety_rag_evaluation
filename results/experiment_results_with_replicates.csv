- The question asks about exceeding a configured Stopping Time safety limit (set to 200 ms) when the robot actually stops in 1000 ms, and what happens. This is about the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and the safety system’s reaction to a safety limit violation.
- The provided facts explicitly cover:
  - The safety functions “Stopping Time Limit” and “Stopping Distance Limit,” and that they are used to ensure the robot can always be stopped within configured limits.
  - That if a safety limit is exceeded (a “Limit Violation”), the safety system initiates a Stop Category 0. This is stated both generally (“If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … then a Stop Category 0 is initiated”) and in the Safety Functions reactions table (“Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0”).
  - How stopping time limits influence robot behavior (speed reduction to meet limits) and that restricting stopping time affects overall speed.
- Although the facts also include sections on MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, and PROFIsafe, which are not required to answer this specific question, they do not make the submission irrelevant. The presence of detailed, directly related safety-limit and reaction information satisfies the relevance criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The Stopping Time Limit is listed as a configurable safety function. If the robot’s actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit, that constitutes a safety limit violation.
- The manual states that any safety limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0 reaction.
- The definition of Stop Category 0 is a hard stop with immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.
- Therefore, if the stopping time limit is set to 200 ms and the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop, that is a violation and the safety system will initiate a Stop Category 0.
- Note: The safety system normally attempts to prevent such violations by dynamically reducing speed so the robot can stop within the configured limits; however, if a violation still occurs, the Stop Category 0 applies.

- The student’s answer states that the safety system will detect a violation and initiate a stop, specifying Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).

2) Verify that Stopping Time is a safety function with enforceable limits
- The facts list Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function and state that the safety system monitors for violations of configured limits.

3) Check the reaction to safety limit violations
- The facts explicitly state: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
- They also state: if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

4) Confirm what Stop Category 0 means
- In the provided facts, Stop Category 0 is defined as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.

5) Consider any nuances that might conflict
- The facts note that Stopping Time/Distance Limit functions dynamically reduce motion to stay within limits, but if a violation nevertheless occurs (as in the student’s hypothetical), the system reaction remains Stop Category 0. This does not contradict the student’s claim.

6) Check for hallucinated content
- The student’s details (200 ms limit, 1000 ms actual stopping time) are a hypothetical example, not contradicting the manual. The description of Stop Category 0 as immediate power removal is directly supported. No extraneous or incorrect claims are introduced.

- This response is concise and focused on the consequence, aligning with typical safety behavior where exceeding a monitored safety limit results in a safety fault and an immediate safe stop.
- While it could mention that such a violation usually latches a safety fault requiring reset, the core consequence (violation detected and immediate safe stop) is clearly conveyed and answers the question.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The facts explicitly address this in the “9. Commissioning” section, which states tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications” and lists specific checks (verify safety I/O, test E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, operational mode icon, enabling device, various safety outputs).
- The “15. Maintenance and Repair” section reinforces that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure safety level and test all safety functions, which directly aligns with post-modification checks.
- “15.1. Testing Stopping Performance” is related to verifying stopping performance, relevant to ensuring safety after changes.
- Additional sections about Safety Configuration, Safety Checksum, and Safe Home relate to verifying and applying safety settings and can be part of post-change verification, thus semantically related.
- While some content (e.g., Program and Installation Manager, About data) is less directly tied, the presence of multiple directly relevant sections means the facts as a whole are relevant.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Check alignment with “9. Commissioning”
- The student lists verifying safety inputs/outputs, testing emergency stops, testing safeguard inputs, checking the initialization screen and mode icon, testing the 3‑position enabling device, and verifying output signals such as Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode. All of these map directly to the commissioning bullets provided.
- They did not introduce anything not present in the commissioning list. Their summary is accurate, even if not exhaustively listing every sub-point (e.g., they don’t explicitly mention brakes engaging or devices common to multiple machines), which is acceptable for grounding.

2) Check alignment with “15. Maintenance and Repair”
- The student states to ensure the required safety level after maintenance/repair and mentions unplugging main power, checking earth connection, observing ESD, and testing safety functions—these are explicitly stated in the Safety for Maintenance warnings and instructions.
- They reference following inspection items such as inspecting cables, mounting bolts, and flat rings—these are listed in the inspection plan and procedures.
- No extra or conflicting maintenance instructions were added.

3) Check for hallucinations or out-of-scope claims
- The student’s statements stay within the content of the provided facts. Phrasing like “safety‑related outputs” generalizes but remains consistent with listed outputs (Emergency Stop outputs, Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode).
- The citation-like bracketed references do not introduce new content and do not contradict the provided facts.

Conclusion:
- The answer is fully grounded in the provided facts and does not contain hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what checks are needed after a modification to a robot arm.
- The student explicitly answers “Yes” and identifies the need to perform commissioning tests after any modification.
- They list concrete, relevant checks: safety I/O verification, emergency stop and safeguard tests, mode/initialization indicators, 3-position enabling device, and safety-related outputs (Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode). These directly address post-modification validation.
- They also mention maintenance/repair checks (power off, earth connection, ESD, safety function tests, visual inspections). While slightly broader than the question, these are still pertinent to ensuring safety and integrity after changes.
- The answer is concise, focused on safety-critical checks, and references source sections without unnecessary detail.

Conclusion:

- The student correctly answers “Yes” and refers to performing commissioning tests after a modification, which aligns with the ground truth.
- They accurately list key checks: verifying safety I/O, testing emergency stops and safeguard inputs, checking initialization/mode indicators, testing the 3-position enabling device, and verifying outputs like Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode. These match the ground truth items.
- While they don’t explicitly mention brake engagement or devices common to multiple machines, their phrasing (“testing emergency stops,” “verifying all safety inputs/outputs”) does not conflict with the ground truth and broadly encompasses these checks.
- The additional mention of maintenance/repair checks is extra information that does not contradict the ground truth and remains factually consistent.

Reasoning:
1) Core claim alignment: The student states that commissioning tests must be conducted after any modification. This matches the FACTS: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.”

2) Checklist items:
- Verifying all safety inputs/outputs are connected and function as intended: explicitly listed in the FACTS.
- Testing emergency stop buttons and inputs for robot stop and brake engagement; testing safeguard inputs and any safeguard reset: explicitly listed in the FACTS.
- Checking the initialization screen with reduced input, verifying operational mode icon changes, and testing the 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual motion: explicitly listed in the FACTS.
- If Emergency Stop outputs are used, pressing the Emergency Stop push-button to verify whole-system stop; and testing Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, and Not Reduced Mode outputs: explicitly listed in the FACTS. Note: The student phrased “press Emergency Stop outputs,” which is imprecise (you press the Emergency Stop push-button; the outputs are monitored). However, the intent and scope match the FACTS.

3) Commissioning requirements: The student notes determining (and adds “documenting”) application-specific commissioning requirements. The FACTS require determining the commissioning requirements. The added word “document” goes a bit beyond the text but stays within the scope and does not introduce conflicting or technical content beyond the FACTS.

4) No extraneous content: The answer stays within the commissioning scope; it does not introduce unrelated procedures (e.g., maintenance, safety password steps) from other sections.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is grounded in the FACTS and does not introduce substantive hallucinations. Minor wording imprecision about “pressing outputs” and the suggestion to “document” requirements do not alter the factual alignment.","Step-by-step reasoning:

- The question asks about a safety limit: if the Stopping Time Limit is set to 200 ms and the robot actually stops in 1000 ms, what happens. Key concepts: “Stopping Time Limit,” exceeding a configured safety limit, and the system’s reaction.
- The provided facts explicitly describe:
  - The Stopping Time Limit safety function and that the system monitors safety limits (Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit) and dynamically reduces speed to keep stopping within limits.
  - What happens on a safety limit violation: the “Trigger Reaction” table states “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0,” and multiple notices indicate that if a fault or violation is detected, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the behavior when the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit (a limit violation → Stop Category 0).
- While there is extra information (e.g., MODBUS, PROFIsafe), the presence of directly relevant safety-limit content satisfies the relevance criterion.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The manual lists Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” Exceeding any safety limit constitutes a “limit violation.”
- The manual’s reaction table states that a “Limit Violation” triggers a “Stop Category 0.”
- Elsewhere, the manual describes Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.
- The student’s example values (200 ms configured vs 1000 ms actual) are illustrative but consistent with the concept of a limit violation; they do not introduce unsupported claims beyond the manual’s scope.

  - Clarify stop categories and when they’re triggered
- Relevant items found in the provided facts:
  - “Stopping Time Limit: Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” This directly matches the keyword and concept in the question.
  - The safety system reactions table: “Trigger: Limit Violation → Reaction: Stop Category 0.” That tells what happens if the limit is exceeded.
  - Notes that stopping time and stopping distance limits dynamically reduce speed so the robot can be stopped within limits, reinforcing the behavior surrounding these limits.
  - Accuracy/performance info for Stopping Time Limit (50 ms) and general warnings/notes that if the safety system detects a fault or violation, a Stop Category 0 is initiated. These support understanding of consequences when limits are exceeded.
- Items that are unrelated (examples):
  - Detailed Fieldbus configuration (MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET) and most of PROFIsafe engineering details unrelated to the specific limit-exceeded behavior.
  - Tool communication, Safe Home configuration, workspace pinch hazards, general I/O setup actions, and Backdrive procedures (unless used to discuss limit enforcement) are not needed to answer this question.
- Conclusion: Because the facts include direct definitions and the reaction to a safety limit violation for Stopping Time, they contain the necessary keywords and semantics to answer the question.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The Stopping Time Limit safety function is defined in the facts as limiting the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a stop is initiated. So comparing an actual stop time to the configured limit is appropriate.
- The facts state that when a safety limit is violated (i.e., any safety function limit is exceeded), the safety system reaction is Stop Category 0.
- The facts also define Stop Category 0 as a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors.
- Applying the scenario: with a configured Stopping Time Limit of 200 ms and an actual stopping time of 1000 ms, the limit is exceeded, therefore a “Limit Violation” occurs, and the system initiates a Stop Category 0. This matches the student’s statement.
- No information outside the provided facts is introduced, and the technical terms align with those in the manual.","Step-by-step reasoning:

- The student directly addresses this by stating that the safety system will detect a violation and initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- This response is concise, focused on the scenario, and clearly describes the outcome (a safety stop due to violation).
- It helps answer the question by specifying the type of stop and why it occurs (exceeding the limit).

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit (200 ms) being exceeded (actual 1000 ms), so a safety limit violation occurs.
- The ground truth specifies that when this safety limit is violated, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- The student states that a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power) will be initiated, which is a different outcome than entering recovery mode.
- Therefore, while the student correctly identifies a safety limit violation, they give an action that conflicts with the ground truth.

- “Testing Stopping Performance” describes periodic stop-time checks, which can be necessary if modifications affect stopping performance.
- The “Software Safety Configuration” and “Safety Checksum” sections are relevant if modifications required safety setting changes; they describe applying, verifying, and locking safety settings and checking the checksum to confirm configuration.
- Other sections (e.g., modes, E-stop behavior, safety I/O functions/outputs) support verifying correct safety reactions and interfaces after changes, which aligns with commissioning checks.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm. Keywords/semantics: after modification, commissioning, safety checks, verification, testing E-stop, safety I/O, mode checks.
- The provided facts contain a “Commissioning” section that explicitly states tests “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” listing specific checks (safety inputs/outputs, E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, operational mode, 3-position enabling device, safety outputs). This is a direct match to the question.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section states that after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and that the correct functioning of all safety functions shall be tested. This is also directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- “Testing Stopping Performance” discusses periodic testing and implications for safeguarding if stopping performance degrades, which is relevant to verifying safety performance after changes.
- The “Software Safety Configuration” and related subsections (setting/changing/applying safety configuration, Safety Checksum) are relevant if the modification involved or affects safety settings; they describe locking/unlocking, applying changes, and verifying via checksum.
- “Safety-related Functions and Interfaces,” “Configurable Safety Functions,” and “Safety inputs/outputs” describe what should be tested/verified (E-stop, safeguard stop, reduced mode, 3PE, robot moving outputs), aligning with the commissioning checks.
- The “Emergency Stop” section provides context for testing/operation of E-stop, which is part of the commissioning tests.
- Several other parts are not needed to answer the question (cleaning agents and grease/PPE guidance, Log tab/exporting reports, Program and Installation Manager, About/robot data, Movement Without Drive Power, Backdrive procedures, some mode-switching details). These are tangential or unrelated to the specific post-modification check question.

2) The provided facts directly cover:
- Definition of Stopping Time Limit: “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- How safety functions behave to meet limits and what happens on violations: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system … a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- General treatment of safety limits and recovery behavior.
3) Therefore, the facts contain the exact safety function and the system reaction when the limit is exceeded, which is directly relevant to the question.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The student claims that exceeding a configured safety limit (Stopping Time Limit) results in a Stop Category 0. The facts state that any safety limit violation triggers Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power). This matches the manual.
- The student adds that all safety outputs will reset to low upon a fault/violation. The facts explicitly say all safety outputs reset to low if the safety system detects any fault or violation. This is correct.
- The student says the safety system must be restarted afterward and that Recovery mode may be activated. The manual states that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted and Recovery Mode is automatically activated to allow moving the robot back within limits. The student’s “may be activated” is slightly less precise than “is automatically activated,” but it is still consistent with the described behavior and not introducing extraneous information.
- No elements in the student’s answer introduce information outside the provided facts (no hallucinations).

Conclusion:
Grounded: True

Notes:
- A slightly more precise phrasing would be that Recovery Mode is automatically activated after a safety limit violation, rather than “may be activated.”","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms and an actual stopping time of 1000 ms. This is a clear violation of the configured safety threshold.
- In most safety systems, exceeding the stopping time limit triggers a safety fault/violation: safety outputs go to a safe state, motion is inhibited, and a reset/restart is required after investigation.
- The student states that the system will detect a limit violation and initiate an immediate power removal (Stop Category 0), followed by the need to restart/reset with safety outputs low. This directly addresses what happens when the limit is exceeded.
- While specifying “Stop Category 0” may be more specific than necessary (the exact stop category can depend on the system/configuration), the core outcome—safety violation, power removal/safe state, and required reset—is correct and relevant.
- The added mention of “Recovery mode may be activated” is somewhat speculative but does not detract from answering the question.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- The answer is concise enough, directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit, and helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth states that exceeding the stopping time safety limit causes the robot to enter recovery mode because safety limits were violated.
- The student correctly identifies that the stopping time exceeded the limit (200 ms vs 1000 ms) and that this constitutes a safety limit violation.
- However, the student says “Recovery mode may be activated,” which implies uncertainty, whereas the ground truth indicates it will enter recovery mode.
- The added detail about initiating a Stop Category 0 and safety outputs going low is not supported or required by the ground truth and introduces specifics that could be inaccurate for this context. Most importantly, it does not clearly state the definite entry into recovery mode.

- The question is about the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and what happens if the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured limit (200 ms).
- The provided facts explicitly define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated” and explain that the safety system dynamically reduces speed to ensure it can stop within configured limits.
- The facts also state the reaction to a safety limit violation: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and elsewhere note that if a safety limit is exceeded, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- Therefore, the facts directly address the mechanism and consequence relevant to the question.
- Although the facts include tangential material (e.g., MODBUS, PROFINET, PROFIsafe configuration details), criterion (2) says if any keywords/semantics are related, consider them relevant. The inclusion of Stopping Time Limit, limit violations, and stop categories satisfies this.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The manual lists Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function that the safety system monitors.
- The reactions table states that any Safety Limit Violation results in a Stop Category 0.
- The Stop Categories section defines Stop Category 0 as stopping the robot by immediate removal of power.
- Applying these facts: if the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop, that exceeds the configured safety limit. Exceeding a safety limit is a violation, which triggers a Stop Category 0, i.e., immediate removal of power.
- Note: While the system attempts to dynamically reduce speed to keep stopping within limits, if a violation does occur, the Cat 0 reaction still applies.

Conclusion:
The student’s answer is fully grounded in the provided facts and contains no unsupported claims.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets a stopping time limit (200 ms) and gives an actual stop time (1000 ms), asking what happens. Exceeding the limit should trigger a safety response.
- The student states that this is a safety limit violation and that the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal). This directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit.
- The answer is concise and focused on the outcome, which is exactly what the question asks.
- While the exact stop category can be system-specific, the student cites documentation indicating Cat 0 for this function, which supports their claim and keeps the answer helpful and relevant.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time limit of 200 ms with an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which is a clear safety limit violation.
- The ground truth specifies that upon such a violation, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- The student answer states that the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), which is a different outcome and does not mention entering recovery mode.
- Therefore, while the student correctly identifies a safety limit violation, the described system response conflicts with the ground truth outcome.

- The question asks what happens if the Stopping Time safety limit is set to 200 ms but the robot actually stops in 1000 ms. This hinges on the “Stopping Time Limit” safety function and the system’s reaction when a safety limit is violated.
- The provided facts explicitly define the Stopping Time Limit (limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping) and state that safety functions dynamically reduce speed to keep stopping within limits.
- Crucially, the facts also specify the safety system’s reactions: a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0, and if any fault or violation is detected, safety outputs reset to low.
- Therefore, the facts contain direct, keyword-relevant content: “Stopping Time Limit,” “Limit Violation,” and “Stop Category 0,” which are exactly what’s needed to answer the question.
- While many other sections (e.g., MODBUS, PROFINET, OSSD details) are not needed for this specific question, the grading criteria say that if ANY relevant content is present, the facts are considered relevant.

- The “Reactions of the safety system” table specifies that a “Limit Violation” triggers a “Stop Category 0.”
- The Stop Categories section defines Stop Category 0 as stopping the robot by immediate removal of power.

Conclusion:
- If the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the actual stopping time is 1000 ms, that exceeds the configured limit, constituting a limit violation.

- The answer is concise, focused on the specific outcome, and explains the safety reaction, which helps answer the question.
- While the exact stop category can be system-dependent, the student’s response clearly describes a plausible and specific safety response, which aids understanding.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The provided facts explicitly cover this scenario:
  - “Commissioning” states tests must be conducted “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and lists specific checks (safety I/O connections, E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode, enabling device, mode icon, various safety outputs).
  - “Maintenance and Repair” says after maintenance/repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and verify correct functioning of all safety functions.
  - “Testing Stopping Performance” discusses periodic testing and conditions under which continuous monitoring suffices.
  - Safety configuration sections describe applying and verifying safety settings (including Safety Checksum) after changes.
- Although many other sections (e.g., Program and Installation Manager, Log Tab, tool/safety plane details) are not strictly necessary to answer the question, the presence of multiple directly relevant items makes the facts relevant under the grading criteria.

Relevance: True","Grounded: True

Reasoning:
- The student states that commissioning tests must be performed before first use or after modifications. This matches the “9. Commissioning” description.
- They list verifying all safety inputs/outputs and testing all connected safety I/O, which aligns with the manual’s requirements.
- They mention testing emergency stops and safeguard inputs; this corresponds to the instructions to test E-stop buttons/inputs and safeguard inputs. Note: they did not explicitly say “and the brakes engage,” but nothing they said contradicts this.
- They refer to checking reduced-mode and mode indications, which aligns with “activate the reduced input and verify the screen changes” and “change the operational mode to verify the mode icon changes.”
- They include testing the 3-position enabling device behavior in manual reduced speed, matching the manual.
- They include verifying behavior when Emergency Stop outputs are used (stop of the whole system), which matches the specified test.
- They include testing systems connected to Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, and Not Reduced Mode outputs, as required.
- They note determining the commissioning requirements for the specific application, which is explicitly listed.
- No extraneous or invented details outside the provided facts are included.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the question’s intent: The user asks if any checks are required after modifying a robot arm.
- Check if the student answers this directly: The student clearly says “Yes” and specifies that commissioning tests must be performed.
- Assess specificity and usefulness: The answer lists concrete checks (safety I/O, emergency stops, safeguard inputs, mode indicators, reduced mode, enabling device, relevant system outputs), which are actionable and directly relevant.
- Evaluate concision and relevance: The response is concise, stays on-topic, and avoids unnecessary details while citing the relevant section for reference.
- Determine if it helps answer the question: It not only confirms that checks are needed but also outlines what to check, thereby helping the user know what to do.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth says “Yes” and lists specific post-modification commissioning tests.
- The student also answers “Yes” and references performing commissioning tests, aligning with the ground truth.
- The student accurately lists key items: verify safety I/O; test emergency stops and safeguard inputs; check mode and reduced-mode indications; test the 3‑position enabling device; test Emergency Stop outputs; test outputs tied to Robot Moving / Robot Not Stopping / Reduced Mode / Not Reduced Mode; and determine application-specific commissioning requirements.
- While the student does not explicitly mention verifying brake engagement, safeguard reset, devices common to multiple machines, or the specific PolyScope/initialization screen wording, their statements are not incorrect and do not conflict with the ground truth. Completeness beyond factual accuracy is not required.

- In the provided facts, multiple sections directly address:
  - The existence and purpose of the Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit safety functions, including that they dynamically reduce speed to ensure the robot can stop within configured limits.
  - The safety system’s reactions to violations: “Limit Violation -> Stop Category 0” and “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system… a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
  - That restricting stopping time affects overall robot speed, reinforcing the meaning of the limit.
- Therefore, the facts contain explicit keywords and semantics directly tied to the question (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0), and explain the expected safety reaction when the limit is exceeded.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The facts state that any safety limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power). This applies to safety functions generally, so exceeding the Stopping Time Limit qualifies as a “Limit Violation” and thus causes a Category 0 stop.
- The facts also state that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery mode is activated and the safety system must be restarted. In Recovery mode, you cannot run programs and must manually move the robot back within limits (via Freedrive or Move tab).
- Additionally, in Recovery mode, limits for joint positions, safety planes, and tool/end effector orientation are disabled, which matches the student’s description.

- The question sets a stopping time limit (200 ms) and describes an actual stop time (1000 ms), asking what happens if the actual exceeds the limit.
- Exceeding a configured stopping time safety limit should trigger a safety response (typically an immediate safe stop and fault that requires reset).
- The student states that exceeding the limit triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power), requires restarting the safety system, and enters Recovery mode with restrictions (no program run, some limits disabled) until recovery.
- This directly addresses “what will happen” when the limit is exceeded. The details about Recovery mode are relevant to what the operator will experience next.
- Conciseness: The answer is slightly more detailed than necessary but remains focused on the consequence of exceeding the limit and is still concise enough to be relevant.

- Identify the key terms in the question: “stopping time safety limit,” a numerical limit (200 ms), an observed stopping time (1000 ms), and “what will happen.”
- Scan the provided facts for these concepts. The facts explicitly define:
  - “Stopping Time Limit: Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
  - The safety system behavior on violations: “Trigger Reaction: Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” and “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system… then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
  - Additional related behavior: safety functions dynamically reduce speed to meet limits and, upon violations, safety outputs reset low.
- Map the question to the facts: The scenario describes exceeding the configured stopping time limit, and the facts state exactly what happens on such a limit violation (Stop Category 0), which directly answers “what will happen.”

Conclusion: The facts contain direct, keyword-matching and semantically aligned information about Stopping Time Limit and the reaction to its violation, so they are relevant.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
- The scenario concerns the Stopping Time Limit safety function. The manual lists Stopping Time Limit as a configurable safety function and states that safety functions monitor limits and react to violations.
- The manual explicitly states that if a safety limit is violated, the safety system initiates a Stop Category 0. This applies to any “Limit Violation.”
- The manual defines Stop Category 0 as stopping the robot by immediate removal of power.
- Therefore, if the configured stopping time limit is 200 ms and the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop (exceeding the configured limit), this constitutes a limit violation and the correct reaction is a Stop Category 0.

Conclusion:
- The student’s answer correctly states both the detection of a safety limit violation and the resulting Stop Category 0 with immediate power removal.
- No information outside the provided facts was introduced.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks what happens when the actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured safety limit (200 ms). This implies a violation of a monitored safety parameter.
- In typical safety systems, exceeding the stopping time limit results in a safety fault and an immediate safety reaction (often removal of power/Stop Category 0), preventing operation until reset.
- The student’s answer states that the safety system detects the violation and initiates a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal), which directly addresses the consequence of exceeding the limit.

Evaluation against criteria:
- Concise and relevant: Yes. The answer is brief and directly addresses the outcome.
- Helps answer the question: Yes. It explains that a limit violation triggers an immediate safety stop.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario describes a stopping time safety limit of 200 ms with an actual stop time of 1000 ms, which is a clear safety limit violation.
- According to the ground truth, when this safety limit is violated, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- The student states that the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power) instead.
- This outcome differs from the ground truth’s specified response (entering recovery mode). The student’s answer does not mention recovery mode and asserts a different behavior, creating a mismatch with the expected outcome.

- The question is about the Stopping Time safety limit: what happens if the robot’s actual stopping time (1000 ms) exceeds the configured limit (200 ms).
- In the provided facts:
  - “Stopping Time Limit” is explicitly defined as limiting the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.
  - It states the safety system monitors safety limits and lists the reaction table: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
  - It further notes that if the safety system detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g., a safety limit is exceeded), a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- Therefore, these facts directly address both the meaning of the stopping time limit and the system’s reaction when it is exceeded, which answers exactly what will happen in the scenario (exceeding 200 ms by stopping in 1000 ms is a limit violation → Stop Category 0).
- While many additional sections (e.g., MODBUS/PROFINET details) are unrelated, the criteria say if any relevant content exists, the facts are considered relevant.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Reasoning:
1) The facts list “Stopping Time Limit” as a configurable safety function. The safety system monitors safety limits and reacts if any are exceeded.
2) The manual explicitly states: if any safety limit is exceeded (a “Limit Violation”), the reaction is a Stop Category 0.
3) The definition of Stop Category 0 in the facts is “Stop the robot by immediate removal of power.”

Application to the student’s scenario:
- If the configured Stopping Time Limit is 200 ms and the robot actually requires 1000 ms to stop, that exceeds the configured limit, i.e., a safety limit violation.
- Per the reaction table, a limit violation triggers Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).

Grounded conclusion:
- The student’s conclusion matches the documented behavior: exceeding Stopping Time Limit causes a Limit Violation, which initiates a Stop Category 0. The “immediate removal of power” description is also exactly how Category 0 is defined in the facts.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question sets up a clear mismatch: the safety stopping time limit is 200 ms, but the actual stop took 1000 ms. This implies a violation of the configured safety parameter.
- Typical safety behavior when a stopping time limit is exceeded is to trigger a safety reaction (fault and safe stop), often resulting in immediate power removal (Stop Category 0) or another configured stop category, and preventing further motion until reset.
- The student’s answer states that the system will detect the limit violation and initiate a Stop Category 0. This directly addresses what will happen when the limit is exceeded.
- The answer is concise and relevant. One minor caveat is that the exact stop category can be configuration-dependent, but the core outcome (safety violation and immediate safe stop) is correct and helpful.

Relevance: True","Correctness: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The scenario: stopping time limit is 200 ms, actual stopping time is 1000 ms. This is a clear safety limit violation.
- The ground truth states that upon such a violation, the robot arm will enter recovery mode.
- The student correctly identifies that a limit violation occurs, but states the system will initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).
- This differs from the ground truth outcome (entering recovery mode). While a stop may precede recovery, the student’s specific claim of Stop Category 0 does not match the stated correct behavior and omits the key outcome (recovery mode), implying a different reaction.
- Therefore, the student answer is not factually accurate relative to the ground truth.",resp_000507ee06428d4b0068fb77f64a78819590f92bfe0cb45cf5,gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,completed,1761310710.0,27696,147,27843

This directly addresses the question.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section says that after maintenance/repair work, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and to test the correct functioning of all safety functions. This is also directly relevant.
- “Testing Stopping Performance” discusses periodic testing and conditions under which continuous monitoring suffices—relevant to post-change verification.
- “Software Safety Configuration” and “Safety Checksum” describe controlling and verifying safety settings after changes, which is pertinent after modifications.
- Additional related safety sections (Emergency events, Modes/Recovery Mode, Safety-related functions and interfaces) support what to verify and how the system behaves after changes.
- Although the facts also contain unrelated items (e.g., Program/Installation Manager, Waypoints, Move tab), the presence of multiple directly relevant sections satisfies the criteria that if ANY part is related, the facts are relevant.

- The provided facts include multiple sections on modes and safety configurations:
  - Section 13.3 “Modes” describes Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, and High Speed Manual Mode.
  - Section 13.3.1 “Recovery Mode” explains Recovery Mode (a type of Manual Mode).
  - Section 13.3.2 “Backdrive” describes Backdrive (a Manual Mode).

Conclusion: The facts contain clear, relevant information about the arm’s safety modes and their names, along with related operational modes.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the topic: The student is describing the safety parameter sets (often called Normal and Reduced) rather than operational modes (Manual/Automatic). The FACTS include a “Safety Parameter Set” section specifying Normal and Reduced configurations.

2) Verify existence and names: The FACTS explicitly state there are two sets: “Normal” and “Reduced.”

3) Verify activation conditions: The FACTS state Reduced can be activated either by a Trigger Reduced Plane or by an external safety input.

4) Verify timing behavior: The FACTS state that when switching via an input, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limits become active; the robot adapts to the new safety limits within 500 ms. This matches the student’s note.

5) Check for hallucinations: The student does not introduce any elements not present in the FACTS. They do not confuse these with operational modes, and they avoid adding unsupported claims.

6) Note on omissions: The student does not mention the 20 mm overlap zone around trigger planes when crossing from reduced to normal, but this is an omission rather than an incorrect or hallucinated claim.

- The provided facts explicitly define Stopping Time Limit as a safety function that limits the maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.
- The facts also state the safety system’s reactions: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0,” and further clarify that if the safety system detects any fault or violation (including exceeding a safety limit), a Stop Category 0 is initiated and all safety outputs reset to low.

  - “When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted… Recovery is activated” (Recovery section).
- These directly support the student’s main points.
- Minor nuance: the student’s supporting note says the violation “faults the safety system.” In the manual, “Fault” is a distinct status (unexpected error). A limit violation triggers a Stop Cat 0 and requires safety system restart, but isn’t necessarily a “Fault” state. However, this imprecision doesn’t introduce new information outside the provided facts.

- “Stopping-time limit violation” is a valid example of a safety limit violation per the facts.
- “Perform a Stop Category 0” exactly matches the specified reaction for limit violations.

Conclusion:
- The FACTS contain direct keywords and semantics (Stopping Time Limit, limit violation, Stop Category 0) needed to answer the question. Therefore they are relevant.

Relevance: True","Reasoning:
1) Relevant facts:
- Stopping Time Limit is a safety function that “limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.” The safety system dynamically reduces speed to keep stopping within limits, but it monitors for any safety limit being exceeded.

- Stop Category 0 is defined as a hard stop with immediate removal of power to the arm and motors.

2) Comparison to the student answer:
- The student states that a violation of the Stopping Time Limit will trigger a Stop Category 0. This aligns with “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0.”
- The student’s definition of Stop Category 0 as immediate removal of power is consistent with the manual’s description.
- No extraneous or contradicting information is introduced.

- Per the cited safety behavior, a violation of the Stopping Time Limit triggers a Stop Category 0, which immediately removes power to the robot actuators.

Evaluation:
- Concise and relevant: Yes. The answer directly states the consequence.
- Helps answer the question: Yes. It explains what happens when the limit is exceeded.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The stopping time limit is 200 ms, and the actual stopping time is 1000 ms, so the safety limit is clearly exceeded.
- The ground truth states that exceeding the safety limit causes the robot to enter recovery mode due to the safety violation.
- The student states that the safety system will register a violation and initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate power removal).
- This does not conflict with the ground truth: acknowledging a safety violation and initiating an immediate safety stop is consistent with a condition that would then require recovery mode. The student’s answer describes the immediate safety action; the ground truth describes the system state following the violation.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm.
- The facts include a “Commissioning” section that explicitly states tests to conduct “before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” This directly answers the question with a checklist (verify safety I/O, test E-stops and safeguard inputs, confirm reduced mode input and mode icons, test the 3-position enabling device, test emergency stop outputs if used, verify status outputs, etc.). Therefore, these facts are clearly relevant.
- Additional relevant material:
  - “Maintenance and Repair” stresses performing safety checks after maintenance/repair and testing safety functions—aligned with post‑modification checks.
  - “Testing Stopping Performance” is a periodic check that could be pertinent if the modification affects stopping behavior.
  - Safety configuration sections (password, applying changes, Safety Checksum) are relevant if the modification involved safety settings or requires confirming the active safety configuration.
  - Joint limits, robot limits, and modes (Normal/Reduced/Recovery) relate to verifying safety behavior after changes.
- Items that are largely unrelated to the specific question about checks after a modification:
  - Detailed cleaning methods, PPE and grease handling warnings, and “Do not use bleach” are maintenance hygiene topics, not checks required after a modification.
  - Program and Installation Manager (creating/loading/saving programs/installations) is administrative and not a safety/functional check after a hardware modification.
  - Accessing robot data via the About menu (General/Version/Legal) is not a required post‑modification check.
  - Safe Home position setup and outputs are only relevant if the modification affects home position; otherwise not a generic “after modification” check.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Rationale: The facts contain a specific commissioning checklist for “after making any modifications” and additional safety/maintenance check guidance. While some sections (cleaning, program management, about/legal) are unrelated, the presence of directly applicable commissioning and safety‑check content makes the facts relevant to the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:

  - 10.4 Software Safety Restrictions and related subsections repeatedly reference Normal, Reduced, and “Normal & Reduced” plane states, reinforcing the safety modes concept.
  - 8.2 Safety I/O and 10.2.1/10.2.2 discuss Reduced Mode signals and transitions, further confirming the safety modes.
- The facts also include operational modes (Manual, Automatic, High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode) and Backdrive, which are modes but not strictly “safety modes.” Even if some content is broader, it still contains the necessary keywords and concepts to answer the question about safety modes.

Conclusion:

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the student’s claims:
- The safety system has two safety parameter sets: Normal and Reduced.
- Reduced mode can be activated by either a Trigger Reduced Plane or an external safety input.
- The arm adapts to the new limits within up to 500 ms.

2) Check each claim against the provided FACTS:
- Two safety parameter sets: Confirmed. The manual states the safety system has “Normal” and “Reduced” parameter sets (Safety Parameter Set, 10.2.3).
- Activation methods: Confirmed. Reduced can be triggered by a Trigger Reduced Plane or externally via a safety input (10.2.3).
- Adaptation timing: Partially correct. The “up to 500 ms” adaptation applies when switching via a safety input (both directions), as explicitly stated in 10.2.3. For trigger planes, the manual instead describes a 20 mm area around the plane where both limits are allowed to prevent nuisance stops; it does not mention a 500 ms timing for plane-triggered transitions.

3) Evaluate for hallucinations or out-of-scope content:
- No extraneous or invented details are present. Terminology and mechanisms match the manual.

4) Overall assessment:
- The answer is grounded in the FACTS. The only nuance missing is that the 500 ms adaptation time is specific to input-triggered switching, whereas plane-triggered switching uses a positional hysteresis (20 mm), not a timed delay.

- Multiple sections reinforce these safety modes, including:
  - 10.2.3 Safety Parameter Set (Normal and Reduced)
  - Safety planes configuration, which can be set to Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, and Trigger Reduced Mode (all referring to how the safety system applies Normal vs Reduced limits)
  - Safety I/O sections describing Reduced mode signals and transitions
- Although there are also operational modes (Automatic, Manual, Recovery, Backdrive), the key safety modes the question is likely referring to are clearly present: Normal and Reduced.

- The FACTS list and describe the following: Automatic Mode and Manual Mode (with the option of High Speed Manual Mode). They also define Recovery Mode explicitly as “a type of Manual Mode” and describe Backdrive as “a Manual Mode used to force specific joints…”.
- The student’s list matches these: Automatic Mode; Manual Mode; Recovery Mode; and Backdrive. They correctly note High Speed Manual Mode as an option within Manual Mode.
- There is no introduction of modes not present in the FACTS, and no contradiction of the nuances (they don’t mischaracterize High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, or Backdrive).

1) Identify the student’s main claim
- The student interprets “safety modes” as the configurable safety parameter sets and states there are two: Normal and Reduced.

2) Verify the claim against the provided facts
- The manual explicitly defines a Safety Parameter Set with two configurations: Normal and Reduced (10.2.3 Safety Parameter Set). This matches the student’s statement.

3) Check the supporting details
- Switching between Normal and Reduced can be triggered by a safety plane (“Trigger Reduced Mode”) or by an external safety input, and the system adapts to the new limits within up to 500 ms when using an input (10.2.3). The student states exactly this.
- The student notes a distinction between operational modes (Automatic, Manual including High Speed Manual, Recovery Mode, Backdrive) and the safety parameter sets. The manual defines these modes in section 13.3 (and 13.3.1, 13.3.2), so this clarification is accurate and grounded.

- The facts also state what the safety system does when a safety limit is exceeded: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0,” and elsewhere, “If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g., if … a safety limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.”
- Additionally, the facts note that when the safety system detects any fault or violation, “all safety outputs reset to low,” which is a direct consequence relevant to the scenario.
- Therefore, the facts contain direct, specific information about the stopping time limit and the resulting reaction when it is violated.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What the manual says happens on a safety limit violation:
- The “Safety Functions” table explicitly states that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0. Also, if the robot detects a fault or violation (e.g., safety limit exceeded), a Stop Category 0 is initiated. This supports the student’s statement that a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

2) Safety outputs behavior on violations:
- The manual notes that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. The student includes this, which matches the facts.

3) Recovery mode after a limit violation:
- The manual’s Recovery section states that when a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted and Recovery is activated. During Recovery, programs cannot run, and the arm must be moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab. The student states that the system then enters Recovery mode, programs cannot run, and the robot must be moved back within limits—consistent with the manual.

- This directly addresses “what will happen” and provides the expected system behavior after the violation.

Conciseness and relevance:
- The answer is concise and focused on the consequence of exceeding the stopping time limit.

Commissioning” section explicitly states “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and then lists checks (safety I/O connections, E-stops, safeguard inputs, reduced mode activation, mode icon change, 3-position enabling device, system outputs, etc.). This directly answers the question.
3) Additional corroborating content: The “Maintenance and Repair” section says that after maintenance/repair, checks must ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions work—again aligned with post-modification checks.
4) Related safety configuration guidance: Sections on Software Safety Configuration, Safety Checksum, and Risk Assessment explain verifying/locking safety settings after changes—relevant to post-modification validation.
5) Other content: Some parts (cleaning agents, program manager, log tab details) are ancillary, but the grading criteria allow some unrelated info as long as relevant content is present.

Conclusion: The provided facts directly address checks required after a modification to the robot arm and are therefore relevant.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Does the manual require commissioning after modifications?
- The FACTS explicitly state that commissioning tests “must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.” The student correctly affirms this.

2) Do the listed checks match the commissioning checklist?
- Safety I/O: Student says to verify connections and test all connected safety inputs/outputs, including shared devices. This matches: “Verify all safety inputs and outputs are correctly connected” and “Test all connected safety input and output, including devices common to multiple machines or robots.”
- Emergency stop: Student notes testing E-stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage. This matches: “Test emergency stop buttons and inputs to verify the robot stops and the brakes engage.”
- Safeguard inputs and 3PE: Student includes testing safeguard inputs (motion stops) and the 3-position enabling device behavior. This matches the commissioning list.
- Mode/icon and reduced mode input: Student mentions verifying mode icon changes in PolyScope and testing reduced mode-related indications/outputs. This aligns with: “Look at the initialization screen, activate the reduced input and verify the screen changes,” “Change the operational mode to verify the mode icon changes,” and “Test the system connected to Robot Moving output, Robot Not Stopping output, Reduced Mode output, or Not Reduced Mode output…”
- Commissioning requirements: Student references determining application-specific commissioning requirements, which is directly listed.

3) Risk assessment linkage:
- The student advises ensuring the application risk assessment is updated and that safety configuration remains appropriate after modification. The FACTS state the risk assessment is required, iterative, and that the integrator must ensure changes to safety settings comply with the risk assessment. This is consistent and grounded.

4) Maintenance/repair safety practices if modification involved disassembly:
- The student’s advice to power off/unplug, check earth connection, and follow ESD precautions matches the Maintenance and Repair safety warnings.

5) Any hallucinated content or contradictions?
- The student does not introduce procedures or requirements not supported by the FACTS. All items mentioned are present in the manual. No contradictions found.

Conclusion: The student’s answer aligns with the provided manual content and does not add unsupported claims.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether checks are needed after a modification and implicitly what they should be.
- The student answer directly addresses this by confirming checks are required and specifies “commissioning tests” and safety verification, which aligns with post-modification best practices.
- It provides concrete, actionable checks (testing safety I/O, E-stops, safeguard/enabling devices, mode indication, safety-related outputs), which helps the user know exactly what to do.
- It includes updating the risk assessment and verifying safety configuration, which is appropriate after modifications.
- The maintenance safety practices are conditional but still relevant if the modification involved repair/disassembly.
- The response is concise, structured in bullet points, and stays on topic without unnecessary information.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth lists specific commissioning/safety checks after a modification: verifying safety I/O, testing all safety inputs/outputs (including shared devices), testing E-stops and brake engagement, safeguard inputs (and reset if configured), checking reduced mode indication and operational mode icon in PolyScope, testing the 3-position enabling device, verifying system behavior if E-stop outputs are used, testing safety-related outputs (Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode), and determining commissioning requirements.
- The student confirms that commissioning tests and safety verification are required and then lists checks that closely match the ground truth: safety I/O verification, testing E-stops with brake engagement, safeguard inputs, 3-position enabling device, PolyScope mode icon change, and testing safety-related outputs (including Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode).
- The student also adds items about updating risk assessment and maintenance safety practices. These are extra but do not conflict with the ground truth.
- No statements in the student answer contradict the ground truth. While the student does not explicitly mention the safeguard reset test or the reduced input/initialization screen change, omission is not penalized per the grading criteria, and the included items are accurate.

- Reduced is activated by a Trigger Reduced plane or external safety input and uses more restrictive limits.
- Recovery is entered when a safety limit is violated; it is associated with a Stop Category 0 and restricts movement to fixed recovery limits to allow returning within limits.

2) Compare against the provided facts:
- 10.3.5 Software Safety Modes explicitly lists Normal, Reduced, and Recovery as the safety modes. Normal is the default; Reduced is triggered by a trigger plane or a configurable input and must be more restrictive; Recovery activates when a safety limit is violated and results in a Stop Category 0. Movement in Recovery is limited to fixed recovery limits and is meant to move the robot back within limits (also supported in 13.3.1 Recovery Mode with the specific recovery limits and Stop Category 0 if violated).

3) Check for hallucinations or inaccuracies:
- All statements align with the manual. No extra, unsupported details were introduced. The mention of Stop Category 0 for Recovery is correct. The summary that movement is restricted to fixed recovery limits to return within limits is consistent with the listed recovery limits and instructions.

1) Reaction to a safety limit violation: The manual states that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power). This matches the student’s claim that the controller will initiate a Stop Category 0.

2) Definition of Stop Category 0: The manual defines Category 0 as stopping by immediate removal of power, which the student correctly references.

3) Recovery mode after a limit violation: The manual specifies that when a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery mode is activated, and you cannot run programs while Recovery is active. The student’s statements about entering Recovery and programs not running are consistent with this.

4) Safety outputs behavior on faults/violations: The manual notes that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. The student’s statement that safety outputs are reset to low is aligned with this.

1) Identify the relevant safety function: The Stopping Time Limit is a configurable safety function that limits the maximum time the robot may take to stop after a stop is initiated.

2) Determine what constitutes a violation: If the actual stopping time exceeds the configured limit, that is a safety limit violation. The manual states that any safety limit violation triggers a defined safety reaction.

3) Confirm the defined reaction for limit violations: The safety system reactions table specifies that a Limit Violation results in a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).

4) Consider post-violation behavior: When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery is activated and the safety system must be restarted. In Recovery mode, the robot cannot run programs but can be manually moved back within limits using Freedrive or the Move tab, with specific recovery limits applied; positional and orientation limits are disabled during recovery, as warned.

- The only slight addition is the word “document” (“determine and document the specific commissioning requirements”). The FACTS say “Determine the commissioning requirements,” without explicitly requiring documentation. This is a minor extrapolation but does not introduce incorrect or conflicting information.
- No other content goes beyond or contradicts the provided FACTS.

Conclusion: The answer is grounded in the FACTS and does not introduce misleading or hallucinated content.","Relevance: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after modifying the robot arm.
- The student immediately answers “Yes” and specifies that commissioning tests must be performed, which directly addresses the query.
- They provide a concise, targeted list of specific checks (safety I/O, E-Stop, safeguard, reduced mode, mode change, 3PE, system stop via E-Stop outputs, and verification of status outputs). These are actionable and directly help the user know what to do.
- The content stays on-topic, avoids unnecessary details, and references the manual section, which supports correctness and completeness.
- The closing note to determine and document application-specific commissioning requirements is relevant and practical, not extraneous.

Therefore, the answer is concise, relevant, and helps answer the question.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth requires performing a series of commissioning tests after any modification, with a specific list of checks.
- The student explicitly says to perform the commissioning tests and then lists checks.

Comparison of listed checks:
- Verify all safety inputs/outputs connected — matches ground truth.
- Test all connected safety inputs/outputs, including shared devices — matches.
- Test Emergency Stop buttons/inputs; robot stops and brakes engage — matches.
- Test safeguard inputs; if Safeguard Reset is configured, verify it — matches.
- Initialization screen: activate Reduced input and verify screen changes — matches.
- Change operational mode; verify mode icon changes in PolyScope — matches.
- Test 3-position enabling device; center-on enables motion in manual at reduced speed — matches.
- If Emergency Stop outputs are used, pressing E-stop stops the whole system — matches.
- Test systems connected to Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced Mode, Not Reduced Mode outputs — matches.
- Determine commissioning requirements — matches the ground truth directive.

- The question asks what checks are needed after making a modification to the robot arm. Keywords/intent: post-modification checks, commissioning, safety verification.
- In the facts, there is a “Commissioning” section that explicitly says: “The following tests must be conducted … after making any modifications” and lists concrete checks (verify safety I/O wiring and function, test E-stops and safeguard inputs, verify reduced mode and mode icon changes, test 3-position enabling device, test safety-related outputs, etc.). This directly answers the question.
- The “Maintenance and Repair” section states that after maintenance/repair, checks must ensure the required safety level and that all safety functions are tested—again directly relevant to post-modification checks.
- “Testing Stopping Performance” mentions periodic testing and considerations if stop time/distance safety functions are used—related to verifying behavior after changes.
- “Recovery/Backdrive Inspection,” “Safety-related Functions and Interfaces,” and “Software Safety Configuration” (including applying and confirming changes, safety checksum) also pertain to ensuring correct and safe operation after configuration or hardware changes.
- While some content (e.g., program/installation manager, tool direction/planes details) is broader, the presence of multiple directly relevant sections means the facts are related to the question per the grading criteria.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Identify the student’s claims
- They assert that after first use or any modification, commissioning tests must be performed, and that safety must be verified after maintenance.
- They list specific commissioning checks: verify safety I/O connections; test all safety inputs/outputs (including shared devices); test emergency stops and brake engagement; test safeguard inputs and safeguard reset; verify reduced input changes the initialization screen; verify operational mode icon changes; test the 3-position enabling device in manual reduced speed; verify Emergency Stop outputs (and other safety outputs) cause the expected system response.

2) Compare each claim against the provided FACTS
- Commissioning requirements: The FACTS (9. Commissioning) explicitly require performing commissioning tests before first use and after modifications, and list the same checks the student enumerates (verify safety I/O connections; test all connected safety I/O including shared devices; test E-stop and brake engagement; test safeguard inputs and reset; verify reduced input changes initialization screen; verify operational mode icon changes; test 3PE enabling device; verify Emergency Stop outputs stop the whole system; verify outputs like Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced are detected). The student’s items match these points. They generalized the final outputs test but did not contradict it.
- Maintenance and safety verification: The FACTS (15. Maintenance and Repair) state that after maintenance and repair, checks must be done to ensure the required safety level and test the correct functioning of all safety functions. The student’s “verify safety after maintenance” is consistent with this.

3) Check for omissions or additions that could constitute hallucinations
- The student did not invent any procedures beyond those in the FACTS. Their general statement about verifying safety after maintenance is supported by the Maintenance section. 
- They omitted “Determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application” and did not explicitly name the “Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced” outputs in one bullet, but omission is not hallucination and does not make the answer ungrounded.
- The trailing “Additional maintenance/safety actions:” is incomplete, but it does not introduce unsupported content.

Conclusion: The student’s answer is grounded in the provided FACTS and does not include hallucinated information.

Grounded: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The question asks whether any checks are needed after modifying the robot arm. This implies looking for post-modification verification or commissioning steps.
- The student explicitly answers ""Yes"" and points to performing commissioning tests and safety verification after maintenance, which aligns directly with the intent of the question.
- The student provides a focused list of specific checks (safety I/O connections and tests, E-stops, safeguard inputs/reset, reduced mode behavior, mode icon update, 3PE in manual, safety outputs) that are concrete and actionable, helping the user understand what to check.
- The content is concise and relevant to the question. The only minor issue is the unfinished “Additional maintenance/safety actions:” line, but it does not introduce irrelevant material or detract from the core guidance.

Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:
- The ground truth says: yes, there is a list of tests after a modification, and then enumerates specific safety and functional checks.
- The student explicitly affirms that commissioning tests and safety verification after maintenance must be performed, which aligns with the ground truth.
- The student lists checks that match the ground truth items:
  - Verifying safety inputs/outputs connections.
  - Testing all safety inputs/outputs including shared devices.
  - Testing emergency stops to ensure robot stops and brakes engage.
  - Testing safeguard inputs and safeguard reset if configured.
  - Checking initialization screen change when Reduced Mode input is activated.
  - Verifying operational mode icon change in PolyScope.
  - Testing the 3-position enabling device in manual mode at reduced speed.
  - If emergency stop outputs or other safety outputs are used, verifying whole-system response and output changes (covers the outputs like Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced/Not Reduced).
- The student’s answer does not contradict any point in the ground truth. Although they don’t explicitly mention “Determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application,” their opening statement to perform commissioning tests is consistent and not conflicting.
- The trailing “Additional maintenance/safety actions:” is incomplete but does not introduce incorrect information.

- The manual explicitly lists three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, and Recovery under Software Safety Modes and Recovery Mode sections.
- Normal is described as the default safety mode.
- Reduced mode is activated either by a Trigger Reduced Plane or by an external/configurable safety input; it uses more restrictive limits.
- Recovery mode activates when a safety limit is exceeded; it is a type of Manual Mode; programs cannot run in Recovery; Stop Category 0 is issued upon violation; it allows moving the arm back within limits (via Freedrive or Move tab) under fixed safety limits.

3) Check for accuracy and omissions:
- The student’s descriptions align with the facts. Mention of Stop Category 0 for Recovery and limited manual movement is correct.

- The question asks specifically about “safety modes,” how many there are, and their names.
- In the provided facts, there is a dedicated section titled “10.3.5. Software SafetyModes” that explicitly defines the safety modes used by the robot’s safety system.
- That section lists three safety modes: Normal mode, Reduced mode, and Recovery mode. It explains when each is active and how they relate to safety limits.
- Additional references to Recovery Mode (e.g., 13.3.1. RecoveryMode) reinforce that Recovery is considered a mode within the safety system.
- While the facts also include other mode concepts (e.g., “Operational modes” such as Automatic and Manual), the “Software SafetyModes” section clearly matches the question’s target (safety modes), providing both the count and the names.

Conclusion:
Relevance: True","Step-by-step reasoning:

- Identify the student’s claims:
  1) There are three safety modes: Normal, Reduced, Recovery.
  2) Normal is the default under normal conditions.
  3) Reduced is activated by trigger planes or a configurable input and uses more restrictive limits.
  4) Recovery is entered when a safety limit is violated (Stop Category 0) and allows limited manual movement to bring the arm back within limits.

- Check against the provided facts:
  • The manual explicitly defines Software Safety Modes as Normal, Reduced, and Recovery (10.3.5). 
  • Normal is the default mode (10.3.5).
  • Reduced mode is activated when the TCP passes a Trigger Reduced plane or via a configurable input and must be more restrictive (10.3.5; 10.2.3).
  • When a safety limit is violated, the safety reaction is Stop Category 0, after which Recovery mode is used to move the arm back within limits via Freedrive or the Move tab, with fixed restrictive limits (10.2.2 Limit Violation → Stop Cat. 0; 10.2.3/13.3.1 Recovery Mode).

- Look for hallucinations or out-of-scope additions:
  • The student did not add claims beyond what is stated in the facts. The mention of Stop Category 0 in relation to a safety limit violation leading to Recovery mode is consistent with the manual.
  • Phrasing like “allows limited manual movement” accurately reflects the described restricted motion in Recovery Mode (with defined limits).

- The provided FACTS explicitly define Stopping Time Limit (“Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated”) and explain that safety functions dynamically reduce speed to ensure the robot can always stop within the limits.
- The FACTS also state the safety system’s reactions: “Limit Violation → Stop Category 0” and note that if the safety system detects a fault or violation, a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
- Additional related notes in the FACTS describe how restricting stopping time/distance affects robot speed and that the controller attempts to prevent violations by slowing or stopping.
- Although the FACTS include many other topics (MODBUS, PROFINET, general I/O, etc.), the presence of the above directly relevant safety-limit content satisfies the criterion that any related information makes the FACTS relevant.

- The FACTS explicitly define the Stopping Time Limit safety function: it “Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is initiated.”
- The FACTS also state the safety system reactions: for a “Limit Violation,” the reaction is “Stop Category 0.” They further note that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low.

- The question asks about the “stopping time safety limit” being set to 200 ms and an actual stop taking 1000 ms, and asks what will happen. This hinges on how the robot’s Safety Function “Stopping Time Limit” behaves when exceeded, and what reaction the safety system triggers on a limit violation.
- The provided facts include multiple sections directly about:
  - Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit as configurable safety functions, and that the safety system dynamically reduces speed to keep within limits.
  - The safety system’s reactions table stating that a “Limit Violation” triggers a Stop Category 0.
  - A general statement that if the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g., safety limit exceeded), a Stop Category 0 is initiated, and that safety outputs reset to low on fault/violation.
  - Stop Categories definitions (IEC 60204-1), clarifying what a Category 0 stop is.
- These passages contain the exact concepts and keywords needed to answer the question (stopping time limit, limit violation, stop category 0).
- While the facts also include large amounts of unrelated material (MODBUS, EtherNet/IP, PROFIsafe details, I/O setup, etc.), the grading criteria allow this as long as there is relevant content.

- Safety outputs behavior: The student adds that safety outputs go low upon such a violation. The manual states that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. This matches.
- Recovery mode behavior: The student says the robot enters Recovery after a safety limit is exceeded and that you must restart the safety system before running programs again. The manual states that Recovery mode activates when a safety limit is violated, you cannot run programs in Recovery, and the safety system must be restarted; the arm must be moved back within limits (e.g., via Freedrive or Move tab) before resuming.

- The provided facts explicitly include a “Commissioning” section that states tests “must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications,” and lists specific checks (verify safety I/O connections, test all safety inputs/outputs, emergency stops, safeguard inputs/resets, reduced mode input, mode icon, 3-position enabling device, Emergency Stop outputs, Robot Moving/Not Stopping/Reduced Mode outputs).
- Additional sections reinforce post-work checks: “Maintenance and Repair” requires safety-level checks and testing of safety functions after maintenance/repair; “Backdrive Inspection” mandates testing Backdrive mode on all joints and verifying safety settings and safety I/O; “Testing Stopping Performance” discusses periodic verification; multiple “Software Safety Configuration” and “Safety-related Functions and Interfaces” sections relate to verifying and applying safety settings after changes.
- Even though many other details are included (payload, mounting, I/O, tool restrictions, etc.), they are not completely unrelated and still connect to verifying correct configuration and safe operation after changes.

Conclusion:
- Relevance: True
- Rationale: The facts directly address required checks after modifications and contain multiple related keywords and procedures (commissioning tests, safety function verification, emergency stop tests, safeguard inputs/outputs, reduced mode, 3PE, etc.).","Grounded: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student states that commissioning tests must be performed “before first use or after any modification.” This matches the Commissioning section: “The following tests must be conducted before using the robot application for the first time or after making any modifications.”
- Their listed checks align with the manual’s bullets:
  - Verifying all safety inputs/outputs are correctly connected, and testing all connected safety I/O (including devices common to multiple machines/robots) matches the first two bullets.
  - Testing Emergency Stop buttons/inputs to ensure the robot stops and brakes engage, and testing Safeguard inputs (including Safeguard Reset if configured) matches the next two bullets.
  - Checking the initialization screen with Reduced Mode input and confirming the screen changes, and changing operational mode to verify the mode icon updates, correspond to the next two bullets.
  - Testing the 3‑position enabling device (center enables motion in Manual at reduced speed) matches the relevant bullet.
  - Verifying safety outputs (Robot Moving, Robot Not Stopping, Reduced/Not Reduced) are detected by connected systems matches the safety output test bullet.
- The student did not introduce requirements outside the provided facts; no hallucinated procedures or features are present.
- Minor omissions (e.g., explicitly pressing E-stop to verify “stop of the whole system” if Emergency Stop outputs are used, and “determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application”) do not contradict the facts and the student labeled their list as an excerpt.
- Therefore, the answer is accurate, within scope of the provided manual content, and free of unsupported claims.","Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the user’s intent: They want to know if any checks are required after modifying a robot arm.
- Check if the student’s answer addresses that: The answer explicitly says “Yes” and directs to perform commissioning tests after any modification.
- Assess helpfulness: It cites the manual and provides a clear, actionable excerpt of recommended checks (safety I/O, E‑Stops, Safeguard, mode behavior, enabling device, safety outputs), which are directly relevant post-modification.
- Evaluate concision and relevance: The answer is concise, focused on required checks, and avoids unrelated details.
