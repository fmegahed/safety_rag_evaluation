Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

13.3.1. RecoveryMode

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

13.3.1. RecoveryMode

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs

The robot also has the following safety inputs:

Safety Input Description

Emergency
Stop Button

Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using
the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is
initiated in anything connected to the output.

Robot
Emergency
Stop

Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) via Control Box input, informing
other machines using the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is
defined.

System
Emergency
Stop

Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) on robot only, in all modes and
takes precedence over all other commands.

Safeguard
Stop

Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in all modes, except when using
a 3-Position Enabling Device and a mode selector - then when in Manual
Mode, the Safeguard Stop can be set to only function in Automatic Mode.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in Automatic mode ONLY.
Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop can only be selected when a Three-
Position Enabling Device is configured and installed.

Safeguard
Reset

Returns from the Safeguard Stop state, when a rising edge on the
Safeguard Reset input occurs.

Reduced
Mode

Transitions the safety system to use the Reduced mode limits.

Three-
Position
Enabling
Device

Initiates a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) when the enabling device is fully
pressed or fully released in manual mode only. Three-Position Enabling
Device Stop is triggered when an input goes low. It is unaffected by a
Safeguard Reset.

Freedrive on
robot

Enables freedrive, when the robot is not in Automatic Mode.

Operational
Mode

Switches between Operational modes. The robot is in Automatic mode
when input is low, Manual mode when input is high.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Reset

Returns from the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop state, when a rising
edge on the Automatic Mode Safeguard Reset input occurs.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.
