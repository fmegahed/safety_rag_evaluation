- The student states Reduced is an alternative, lower set of safety limits that can be triggered by a safety plane or a safety input. This matches the facts: Reduced can be activated by crossing a Trigger Reduced Plane or via a configured safety input.
- The student adds that the system transitions within 500 ms. The facts specify that when switching due to an input, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limits become active (both directions). Saying “within 500 ms” is consistent with “up to 500 ms.”

- Identify the student’s main claim: “The safety system will detect a violation and initiate a Stop Category 0 (immediate removal of power).”
- Compare with the manual:

  - The meaning of Stop Category 0 as “immediate removal of power” is corroborated in the PROFIsafe section’s status definitions: Stop, cat. 0 is “a hard stop by immediate removal of power to the arm and the motors” (12.5 PROFIsafe).
- Evaluate the supporting point:
  - The student notes that Stopping Time Limit dynamically reduces speed so the robot can always stop within the configured time, and exceeding that would be a safety limit violation. The manual supports this: Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit “dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can always be stopped within the limits,” and limits like position/safety planes take the expected stopping distance into account (10.2.1 Configurable Safety Functions).

- The question asks about exceeding a configured Stopping Time safety limit (set to 200 ms) and what happens if the robot actually takes 1000 ms to stop. Key concepts: “Stopping Time Limit,” “limit violation,” and the resulting safety reaction (stop category).
- I looked for any facts that describe the Stopping Time Limit, how safety limits are enforced, and what reaction occurs upon a limit violation (e.g., Stop Category 0). Mentions of safety modes (Normal/Reduced/Recovery) and how violations transition the robot are also relevant. Even interfaces that report stop categories (e.g., PROFIsafe) are relevant since they define and communicate the exact outcomes (Stop Cat 0/1/2, Violation).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The student claims that a safety limit violation triggers a Stop Category 0 and that the robot enters Recovery. The manual explicitly states that a “Limit Violation” results in Stop Category 0 and that Recovery mode activates when a safety limit is violated, with the robot performing a Stop Category 0. This matches the student’s statement.
- The student notes that the Stopping Time Limit defines the maximum allowed stop time after a stop is initiated and that exceeding it constitutes a limit violation. The manual defines Stopping Time Limit precisely this way, so this is accurate.
- The student states that on violation the safety outputs reset to low. The manual says that if the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs reset to low. This aligns with the student’s statement.
- The student adds that programs cannot run until Recovery is cleared and that caution is required when moving the arm back within limits. The manual confirms that programs cannot run while Recovery is active and warns to use caution because certain limits are disabled in Recovery mode.

This directly answers the question about checks after a modification.

okg5aalok03t07_0009__faithfulness,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What the FACTS say:
- The Commissioning section requires that specific tests be conducted before first use and after any modifications. It lists concrete checks: verifying safety I/O wiring, testing all safety inputs/outputs (including shared devices), testing E-stops (robot stops and brakes engage), testing safeguard inputs and any safeguard reset, checking initialization screen response to reduced input, verifying the operational mode icon change in the top-right of PolyScope, testing the 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual motion, verifying system-wide stop if Emergency Stop outputs are used, and testing systems connected to Robot Moving/Robot Not Stopping/Reduced Mode/Not Reduced Mode outputs. It also says to determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application.
- The Maintenance and Repair section requires that after maintenance/repair, safety checks must be done and correct functioning of all safety functions must be tested.

2) Compare to the STUDENT ANSWER:
- The student correctly states that after any modification, you must perform the commissioning tests listed in the manual—this matches the Commissioning description.
- The student lists the required checks, and each item aligns with the bullets in the Commissioning section (verify safety I/O connections; test all safety I/O including shared devices; test E-stops with stop and brake engagement; test safeguard inputs and safeguard reset; check initialization screen change when reduced input is activated; verify operational mode icon changes; test 3-position enabling device for reduced-speed manual; verify system-wide stop if E-stop outputs are used; test systems tied to Robot Moving/Robot Not Stopping/Reduced Mode/Not Reduced Mode outputs). Wording differences (e.g., “PolyScope header” vs “top right corner”) are consistent with the intent.
- The student adds that post-maintenance safety checks should ensure all safety functions operate as intended—this is explicitly supported by the Maintenance and Repair section.

3) Check for omissions or hallucinations:
- No extraneous or invented procedures are introduced.
- The only Commissioning bullet not explicitly restated is “Determine the commissioning requirements of your robot application.” However, the student prefaced the list as “at minimum,” which does not contradict the manual, and the rest is accurate. This omission does not introduce ungrounded content.

- The question asks about “safety modes” of the arm and wants both the count and the names. Interpreting “safety modes” could reasonably refer to:
  - The safety parameter sets (Normal and Reduced) explicitly called out in the safety system, or
  - Operational/motion modes that have safety implications (Automatic, Manual, High Speed Manual Mode, Recovery Mode, Backdrive), or
  - Safety plane mode settings (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced), which are explicitly labeled as “modes” within the safety configuration.
- The provided facts directly mention multiple relevant mode constructs:
  - 13.3 Modes: Automatic Mode, Manual Mode, High Speed Manual Mode; plus Recovery Mode (13.3.1) and Backdrive (13.3.2), clearly about modes of operation with safety behavior.
  - 10.2.3 Safety Parameter Set: explicitly defines Normal and Reduced as safety parameter configurations (“safety limits for each set of safety parameters”), often colloquially referred to as safety modes.
  - 10.4 Software Safety Restrictions: Safety planes have mode states (Disabled, Normal, Reduced, Normal & Reduced, Trigger Reduced) tied to the safety system’s Normal/Reduced modes.
  - 8.2 Safety I/O and 19.2 Table: discuss Operational Mode switching and Reduced Mode signals, reinforcing the Normal/Reduced safety configurations.
- Even sections that go into I/O, OSSD pulses, and safety inputs/outputs are still within the context of safety system modes and transitions (e.g., Reduced Mode triggers), thus semantically related.
