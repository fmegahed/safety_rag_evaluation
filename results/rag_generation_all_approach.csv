Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

13.3.1. RecoveryMode

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

Table The functional difference is shown below.

caution

Use the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop
Output. Configuring a set of configurable I/O for safety functions are done through the GUI,
(see part Part II PolyScope Manual).

CAUTION

Failure to verify and test the safety functions regularly can lead to
hazardous situations.

• Safety functions shall be verified before putting the robot into
operation.

• Safety functions shall be tested regularly.

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

Mode
When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

3-position enabling device.
When in teach/program, initially both TCP speed and elbow speed will
be limited to 250mm/s. The speed can manually be increased by using
the pendant user interface “speed-slider”, but upon activation of the

integrator and not the robot manufacturer. ISO 10218-1:2011, clause 5.10 collaborative
operation details 4 collaborative operation techniques as explained below. It is very
important to understand that collaborative operation is of the APPLICATION when in
AUTOMATIC mode.

5.10.2

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Safety-rated
monitored
stop

Stop condition where position is held at a
standstill and is monitored as a safety
function. Category 2 stop is permitted to
auto reset. In the case of resetting and
restarting operation after a safety -rated
monitored stop, see ISO 10218-2 and
ISO/TS 15066 as resumption shall not
cause hazardous conditions.

UR robots’ safeguard
stop is a safety-rated
monitored stop, See SF2
on page 1. It is likely, in
the future, that “safety-

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Description This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.

WARNING

Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.

1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.

2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.

3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.

4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.

5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

Table The functional difference is shown below.

caution

Use the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop
Output. Configuring a set of configurable I/O for safety functions are done through the GUI,
(see part Part II PolyScope Manual).

CAUTION

Failure to verify and test the safety functions regularly can lead to
hazardous situations.

• Safety functions shall be verified before putting the robot into
operation.

• Safety functions shall be tested regularly.

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

3-position enabling device.
When in teach/program, initially both TCP speed and elbow speed will
be limited to 250mm/s. The speed can manually be increased by using
the pendant user interface “speed-slider”, but upon activation of the

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Description This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.

WARNING

Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.

1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.

2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

NOTICE
• Some UR robot sizes might not be equipped with a Three-Position
Enabling Device. If the risk assessment requires the enabling
device, a 3PE Teach Pendant must be used.

WARNING
• Any suspended safeguards must be returned to full functionality
before selecting Automatic Mode.

• Wherever possible, Manual Mode shall only be used with all
persons located outside the safeguarded space.

• If an external mode selector is used, it must be placed outside the
safeguarded space.

• No-one is to enter, or be within, the safeguarded space in Automatic
Mode, unless safeguarding is used or the collaborative application
is validated for power and force limiting (PFL).

To Switch
Modes: PolyScope

1. In the Header, select the profile icon.

• Automatic indicates the operational mode of the robot is set to
Automatic.

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

Input
Signals Operational

When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

3-position enabling device.
When in teach/program, initially both TCP speed and elbow speed will
be limited to 250mm/s. The speed can manually be increased by using
the pendant user interface “speed-slider”, but upon activation of the

Technique Explanation UR e-Series

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Description This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.

WARNING

Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.

1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.

2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.

3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.

4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.

5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.

Safety Checksum

Description The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.

It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.

The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

8.5. Teach Pendant with 3-Position EnablingDevice

Description Depending on the robot generation, your Teach Pendant can be with or without a 3-
Position Enabling device (3PE).
UR20 and UR30 robots have the built-in 3PE called a 3-Position Enabling Teach
Pendant (3PE TP). The Teach Pendant without the 3PE will not work with the UR20 and
UR30.
The enabling buttons are on the underside of the Teach Pendant, as illustrated below.
You can use either button, according to your preference. If the Teach Pendant is
disconnected, an external 3PE device must be connected and configured. The 3PE TP
functionality extends to the PolyScope interface, where there are additional functions in
the Header.

NOTICE

The 3PE Teach Pendant is not included with the purchase of the OEM
Control Box, so enabling device functionality is not provided. Using a
UR20, or a UR30, requires an external enabling device or a 3PE Teach
Pendant when programming, or teaching, within the reach of the robot
application. See ISO 10218-2.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

13.3.1. RecoveryMode

Description When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Safety limits
of Recovery
Mode

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.

13.3.2. Backdrive

Description Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.
The robot joints feel heavy to move, while Backdrive is in use.

You can use any of the following sequences to enable Backdrive:

• 3PE Teach Pendant

• 3PE device/switch

• Freedrive on robot

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0
Fault Detection Stop Category 0

NOTICE

If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Description Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the

emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.

13.1. Emergency Stop

Description The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).

Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.

To reset the emergency stop push-button

1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.

You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.

2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.

3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. MovementWithout Drive Power

Description In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.

To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.

Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.

See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.

WARNING

Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.

• Support the robot arm before removing power.

NOTICE

Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.

• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.

• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes

Description You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.

Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.

High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.

The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.

Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description
NOTICE

Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.

Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.

WARNING

Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.

Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.

Disabled The safety plane is never active in this state.

Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.

Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.

Trigger Reduced
Mode

The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.

Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.

Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.

Rename Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Elbow
Restriction

You can enable Restrict Elbow to prevent robot elbow joint from passing through any of
your defined planes. Disable Restrict Elbow for elbow to pass through planes.
The diameter of the ball that restricts the elbow is different for each size of robot.

UR3e 0.1 m
UR5e 0.13 m
UR10e / UR16e 0.15 m
UR20 / UR30 0.19 m

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].

Tool Flange
Restriction

Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.

Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.

You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.

Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example

Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.

The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example

In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)

If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction

Description The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.

NOTICE

Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties

The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:

1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.

2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.

Disabled Tool direction limit Never active
Normal Tool direction limit Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit

Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.

You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.

Tool
Prope
rties

By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:

• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange

• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.

Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction

Description The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.

• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.

• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.

• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.

Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools

For the user defined tools, the user can change:

• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).

• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.

You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning

You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:

• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.

To configure the tool position

1. In the Header tap Installation.

2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.

3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.

• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.

4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.

5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.

Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.

Description Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.

WARNING

The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.

• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.

WARNING: ELECTRICITY

Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.

• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.

Additional
Information NOTICE

• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)

• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment

• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.

NOTICE

The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions

Description Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.

Safety
Function

Description

Joint Position
Limit

Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.

Joint Speed
Limit

Sets an upper limit for joint speed.

Safety
Planes

Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.

Tool
Orientation

Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.

Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.

Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.

Momentum
Limit

Limits maximummomentum of the robot.

Power Limit Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit

Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1

Stopping
Distance
Limit

Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.

Safety
Function

When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION

Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.

• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.

NOTICE

There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Front Tilted

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm

of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.

Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
outputs

For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:

Safety
Output

Description

System
Emergency
Stop

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.

Robot
Moving

While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.

Robot Not
Stopping

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.

Reduced Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.

All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).

10.2.2. Safety Functions

Description The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:

Trigger Reaction

Emergency Stop Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected) Stop Category 2
Limit Violation Stop Category 0

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set

Description The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:

• Normal

• Reduced

Normal and
Reduced

You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:

• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal

• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Safety Function Limit

Joint Speed Limit 30 °/s
Speed Limit 250 mm/s
Force Limit 100 N
Momentum Limit 10 kg m/s
Power Limit 80 W

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.

WARNING

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.

• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.

Safety I/O This section describes dedicated safety input (Yellow terminal with red text) and configurable
I/O (Yellow terminals with black text) when configured as safety I/O.
Safety devices and equipment must be installed according to the safety instructions and the
risk assessment in chapter Safety.
All safety I/O are paired (redundant), so a single fault does not cause loss of the safety
function. However, the safety I/O must be kept as two separate branches.

The permanent safety input types are:

• Robot Emergency Stop for emergency stop equipment only

• Safeguard Stop for protective devices

• 3PE Stop for protective devices

Use the configurable I/O to set up additional safety I/O functionality, e.g. Emergency Stop
Output. Configuring a set of configurable I/O for safety functions are done through the GUI,
(see part Part II PolyScope Manual).

CAUTION

Failure to verify and test the safety functions regularly can lead to
hazardous situations.

• Safety functions shall be verified before putting the robot into
operation.

• Safety functions shall be tested regularly.

OSSD
signals

All configured and permanent safety inputs are filtered to allow the use of OSSD safety
equipment with pulse lengths under 3ms. The safety input is sampled every millisecond and
the state of the input is determined by the most frequently seen input signal over the last 7
milliseconds.

OSSD
Safety
Signals

You can configure the Control Box to output OSSD pulses when a safety output is
inactive/high. OSSD pulses detect the ability of the Control Box to make safety outputs
active/low. When OSSD pulses are enabled for an output, a 1ms low pulse is generated on
the safety output once every 32ms. The safety system detects when an output is connected
to a supply and shuts down the robot.
The illustration below shows: the time between pulses on a channel (32ms), the pulse length
(1ms) and the time from a pulse on one channel to a pulse on the other channel (18ms)

To enable OSSD for Safety Output

1. In the Header, tap Installation and select Safety.

2. Under Safety, select I/O.

3. On the I/O screen, under Output Signal, select the desired OSSD checkbox. You must
assign the output signal to enable the OSSD checkboxes.

Default safety
configuration

The robot is delivered with a default configuration, which enables operation without any
additional safety equipment (see illustration below).

Sharing the
Emergency
Stop with other
machines

You can set up a shared emergency stop function between the robot and other machines
by configuring the following I/O functions via the GUI. The Robot Emergency Stop Input
cannot be used for sharing purposes. If more than two UR robots or other machines need
to be connected, a safety PLC must be used to control the emergency stop signals.

• Configurable input pair: External emergency stop.

• Configurable output pair: System emergency stop.

The illustration below shows how two UR robots share their emergency stop functions. In
this example the configured I/Os used are CI0-CI1 and CO0-CO1.

8.2.1. I/O Signals

Description The I/O are divided between inputs and outputs and are paired up so that each function
provides a Category 3 and PLd I/O.

Input
Signals

The following Safety Functions can be used with the input signals:

System
Emergency
Stop

This is an emergency stop button alternative to the one on the Teach
Pendant, providing the same functionality if the device complies with
ISO 13850.

Reduced

All safety limits can be applied while the robot is using a Normal
configuration, or a Reduced configuration (see Software Safety
Modes). When configured, a low signal sent to the inputs causes the
safety system to transition to the reduced configuration. The robot arm
decelerates to satisfy the reduced parameters.
The safety system guarantees the robot is within reduced limits less
than 0.5s after the input is triggered. If the robot arm continues to
violate any of the reduced limits, a Stop Category 0 is triggered. Trigger
planes can also cause a transition to the reduced configuration. The
safety system transitions to the normal configuration in the same way.

3-Position
Enabling
Device

In Manual Mode, an external 3-Position Enabling Device must be
pressed and held in the center-on position to move the robot. If you are
using a built-in 3-Position Enabling Device, the button must be pressed
and held in the mid position to move the robot.

Freedrive on
robot

You can configure the Freedrive input to enable and use Freedrive
without pressing the Freedrive button on a standard TP, or without
having to press-and-hold any of the buttons on the 3PE TP in the light-
press position.

When defined, this input can be used to switch between Automatic
Mode and Manual Mode.

Safeguard
Reset

When a Safeguard Stop occurs, this output ensures that the
Safeguard Stop state continues until a reset is triggered.

Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop

Once configured, an Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop performs a
Safeguard Stop when the input pins are low and ONLY when the
robot is in Automatic mode.

WARNING
• If you disable the default Safeguard Reset input, the Robot Arm is no
longer Safeguard Stop stopped as soon as the input is high. A program
paused only by the Safeguard stop resumes.

• Similar to the Safeguard Reset, if the default Automatic Mode
Safeguard Reset is disabled, the Robot Arm is no longer Safeguard
Stop stopped once the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop input is high. A
program paused only by the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop resumes.

Output
Signals

You can apply the following Safety functions for output signals. All signals return to low when the
state which triggered the high signal has ended:

System
Emergency
Stop

Signal is Low when the safety system has been triggered into an
Emergency Stopped state by the Robot Emergency Stop input or the
Emergency Stop Button. To avoid deadlocks, if the Emergency
Stopped state is triggered by the System Emergency Stop input, low
signal will not be given.

Robot Moving Signal is Low if the robot is moving, otherwise high.

Robot Not
Stopping

Signal is High when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping
due to an emergency stop or safeguard stop. Otherwise it will be logic
low.

Reduced
Signal is Low when the robot arm uses reduced parameters or if the
safety input is configured with a reduced input and the signal is
currently low. Otherwise the signal is high.

Not Reduced This is the inverse of Reduced, defined above.

Safe Home
Signal is High if the Robot Arm is stopped in the configured Safe
Home Position. Otherwise, the signal is Low.

NOTICE

Any external machinery receiving its Emergency Stop state from the robot
through the System Emergency Stop output must comply with ISO 13850. This
is particularly necessary in setups where the Robot Emergency Stop input is
connected to an external Emergency Stop device. In such cases, the System
Emergency Stop output becomes high when the external Emergency Stop
device is released. This implies that the emergency stop state at the external
machinery will be reset with no manual action needed from the robot’s
operator. Hence, to comply with safety standards, the external machinery must
require manual action in order to resume.

8.2.2. I/O Setup

Description Use the I/O Setup screen to define I/O signals and configure actions with the I/O tab
control. The types of I/O signals are listed under Input and Output.
You can use a fieldbus, for example, Profinet and EtherNet/IP, to access the general
purpose registers.
If you enable the Tool Communication Interface (TCI), the tool analog input becomes
unavailable.

NOTICE

When starting programs from an I/O or fieldbus input, the robot can
begin movement from the position it has, there will not be any manual
movement to the first waypoint via PolyScope required.

I/O Signal
Type

To limit the number of signals listed under Input and Output, use the View drop-down menu
to change the displayed content based on signal type.

Assigning
User-defined
Names

You can name the Input and Output signals to easily identify the ones being used.

1. Select the desired signal.

2. Tap the text field to type a name for the signal.

3. To reset the name to default, tap Clear.

You must provide a user-defined name for a general purpose register to make it available in
the program (i.e., for a Wait command or the conditional expression of an If command).
The Wait and If commands are described in (Wait) and (If), respectively. You can find
named general purpose registers in the Input or Output selector on the Expression Editor
screen.

Speed and
separation
monitoring
(SSM) safety
functions

SSM is the robot
maintaining a separation
distance from any
operator (human). This is
done by monitoring of the
distance between the
robot system and
intrusions to ensure that
the MINIMUM
PROTECTIVE
DISTANCE is assured.
Usually, this is
accomplished using
Sensitive Protective
Equipment (SPE), where
typically a safety laser
scanner detects intrusion
(s) towards the robot
system.
This SPE causes:

1. dynamic changing
of the parameters
for the limiting
safety functions; or

2. a safety-rated
monitored stop
condition.

Upon detection of the
intrusion exiting the
protective device’s
detection zone, the robot
is permitted to:

1. resume the
“higher” normal
safety function
limits in the case of
1) above

2. resume operation
in the case of 2)
above

In the case of 2) 2),
restarting operation after
a safety -rated monitored
stop, see ISO 10218-2
and ISO/TS 15066 for
requirements.

To facilitate SSM, UR robots have the
capability of switching between two sets of
parameters for safety functions with
configurable limits (normal and reduced).
See Reduced Mode on page 4. Normal
operation can be when no intrusion is
detected. It can also be caused by safety
planes/ safety boundaries. Multiple safety
zones can be readily used with UR robots.
For example, one safety zone can be used
for “reduced settings” and another zone
boundary is used as a safeguard stop input
to the UR robot. Reduced limits can also
include a reduced setting for the stop time
and stop distance limits – to reduce the
work area and floorspace.

Power and
force limiting
(PFL) by
inherent
design or
control

How to accomplish PFL is left to the
robot manufacturer. The robot
design and/or safety functions will
limit the energy transfer from the
robot to a person. If any parameter
limit is exceeded, a robot stop
happens. PFL applications require
considering the ROBOT
APPLICATION (including the end-
effector and workpiece(s), so that
any contact will not cause injury. The
study performed evaluated
pressures to the ONSET of pain, not
injury. See Annex A. See ISO/TR
20218-1 End-effectors.

UR robots are power and force
limiting robots specifically
designed to enable
collaborative applications where
the robot could contact a person
and cause no injury. UR robots
have safety functions that can
be used to limit motion, speed,
momentum, force, power and
more of the robot. These safety
functions are used in the robot
application to thereby lessen
pressures and forces caused by
the end-effector and workpiece
(s).

Description This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.

WARNING

Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.

1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.

2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.

3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.

4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.

5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

10.3.3. Applying aNewSoftware Safety Configuration

Description The robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.
Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.

Safety Checksum

Description The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.

It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.

The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.

10.3.5. Software SafetyModes

Description Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:

• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default

• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.

• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.

WARNING

Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.

The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.

10.3.6. Software Safety Limits

Description In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Robot Limits

Description Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.

1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

8.5. Teach Pendant with 3-Position EnablingDevice

Description Depending on the robot generation, your Teach Pendant can be with or without a 3-
Position Enabling device (3PE).
UR20 and UR30 robots have the built-in 3PE called a 3-Position Enabling Teach
Pendant (3PE TP). The Teach Pendant without the 3PE will not work with the UR20 and
UR30.
The enabling buttons are on the underside of the Teach Pendant, as illustrated below.
You can use either button, according to your preference. If the Teach Pendant is
disconnected, an external 3PE device must be connected and configured. The 3PE TP
functionality extends to the PolyScope interface, where there are additional functions in
the Header.

NOTICE

The 3PE Teach Pendant is not included with the purchase of the OEM
Control Box, so enabling device functionality is not provided. Using a
UR20, or a UR30, requires an external enabling device or a 3PE Teach
Pendant when programming, or teaching, within the reach of the robot
application. See ISO 10218-2.

Software Safety Restrictions
Description
NOTICE
Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.
Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.
WARNING
Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.
Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es
You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.
Disabled
The safety plane is never active in this state.
Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.
Trigger Reduced
Mode
The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.
Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.
Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.
Rename
Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Configuring
safety planes
1. In your PolyScope header, tap Installation.
2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Planes.
3. On the top right of the screen, in the Planes field, tap Add plane.
4. On the bottom right of the screen, in the Properties field, set up Name, Copy

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].
Tool Flange
Restriction
Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.
Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.
You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.
Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example
Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.
The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example
In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)
If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction
Description
The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.
NOTICE
Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties
The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:
1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.
2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.
Disabled Tool direction limit
Never active
Normal Tool direction limit
Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit
Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit
Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.
You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.
Tool
Prope
rties
By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:
• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange
• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.
Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction
Description
The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.
• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.
• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.
• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.
Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools
For the user defined tools, the user can change:
• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).
• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.
You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning
You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:
• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.
To configure the tool position
1. In the Header tap Installation.
2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.
3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.
• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.
4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.
5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example
In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.
The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.
Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__05__10.5._The_First_Program__pp133-162_part01.pdf'><content>10.5. The First Program
Description
A program is a list of commands telling the robot what to do. For most tasks,
programming is done entirely using the PolyScope software. PolyScope allows you to
teach the robot arm how to move using a series of waypoints to set up a path for the
robot arm to follow.
Use the Move tab to move the Robot Arm to a desired position, or teach the position by
pulling the Robot Arm into place while holding down the Freedrive button at the top of the
Teach Pendant.
You can create a program can to send I/O signals to other machines at certain points in
the robot’s path, and perform commands like if…then and loop, based on variables and
I/O signals.

To create a
simple
program
1. On PolyScope, in the Header File Path, tap New... and select Program.
2. Under Basic, tap Waypoint to add a waypoint to the program tree. A default MoveJ is
also added to the program tree.
3. Select the new waypoint and in the Command tab, tap Waypoint.
4. On the Move Tool screen, move the robot arm by pressing the move arrows.
You can also move the robot arm by holding down the Freedrive button and pulling the
Robot Arm into desired positions.
5. Once the robot arm is in position, press OK and the new waypoint displays as
Waypoint_1.
6. Follow steps 2 to 5 to create Waypoint_2.
7. Select Waypoint_2 and press the Move Up arrow until it is above Waypoint_1 to
change the order of the movements.
8. Stand clear, hold on to the emergency stop button and in the PolyScope Footer, press
Play button for the Robot Arm to move between Waypoint_1 and Waypoint_2.
Congratulations! You have now produced your first robot program that moves the
Robot Arm between the two given waypoints.
NOTICE
1. Do not drive the robot into itself or anything else as this may cause
damage to the robot.
2. This is only a quick start guide to show how easy it is to use a UR
robot. It assumes a harmless environment and a very careful user.

10.5.6. Using Basic Program Nodes
Description
Basic program nodes are used to create simple robot applications. Some basic program
nodes are also used to organize your robot program and create comments in your robot
program. This can be quite useful, if it is large robot program.
10.5.7. Basic Program Nodes: Move
Description
The Move command allows the robot to move from point A to point B.
How the robot moves is important to the task the robot is performing.
When you add a Move to your program tree, the Move pane appears to the right of the
screen.
The Movecommand controls the robot&#x27;s motion via waypoints.
Waypoints are automatically added when you add Move commands to a program.
Read more about Waypoints.
You can also use Moves to set acceleration and speed for the robot arm&#x27;s movement
between waypoints.
The robot moves using four Move commands. See the Move command types below:
MoveJ
The MoveJ command creates a movement from point A to point B that is optimal for the
robot.
The movement may not be a direct line between A and B, but optimal for the start position of
the joints and the end position of the joints.

Add a MoveJ
command
1. In your robot program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveJ in the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveJ makes movements that are calculated in the robot arm joint space. Joints are
controlled to finish their movements at the same time. This movement type results in a
curved path for the tool to follow. The shared parameters that apply to this movement type
are the maximum joint speed and joint acceleration, specified in deg/s and deg/s2,
respectively. If it is desired to have the robot arm move fast between waypoints,
disregarding the path of the tool between those waypoints, this movement type is the
preferable choice.
MoveL
The MoveL command creates a movement that is a direct line from point A and point B.
Add a MoveL
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveL from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveL moves the Tool Center Point (TCP) linearly between waypoints. This means that
each joint performs a more complicated motion to keep the tool on a straight line path. The
shared parameters that can be set for this movement type are the desired tool speed and
tool acceleration specified in mm/s and mm/s2, respectively, and also a feature.
MoveP
The MoveP command creates a movement with a constant speed between the waypoints.
Blend between waypoints is enabled to ensure constant speed. (See Blending).
Add a MoveP
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with the
Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveP moves the tool linearly with constant speed with circular blends, and is intended for
some process operations, like gluing or dispensing. The size of the blend radius is by
default a shared value between all the waypoints. A smaller value will make the path turn
sharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. While the robot arm is moving
through the waypoints with constant speed, the robot control box cannot wait for either an
I/O operation or an operator action. Doing so might stop the robot arm’s motion, or cause a
robot stop.

MoveCircle
The MoveCircle command creates a circular movement, by creating a half circle.
You can only add CircleMove via a MoveP command.
Add a
MoveCircle
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move.
A waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
5. Tap Add circle move
6. Select the orientation mode.
Detail
The robot starts the circular movement from its current position, or start point, and moves
through a ViaPoint specified on the circular arc, to an EndPoint that completes the circular
movement.
A mode is used to calculate tool orientation, through the circular arc.
The mode can be:
• Fixed: only the start point is used to define the tool orientation.
• Unconstrained: the start point transforms to the EndPoint to define tool orientation.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='002__L1__2._Your_Robot__pp12-27.pdf'><content>2. Your Robot

coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

2.4.1. Icons/Tabs On PolyScope

Description
Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the
emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.
13.1. Emergency Stop
Description
The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

A 3PE Teach Pendant is recommended for programming. If another person can be within
the safeguarded space when in Manual Mode, an additional device can be integrated and
configured for the additional person&#x27;s use.

13.3.1. Recovery Mode
Description
When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.
During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.
13.3.2. Backdrive
Description
Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.

Software Safety Restrictions
Description
NOTICE
Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.
Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.
WARNING
Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.
Saf

You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.
Disabled
The safety plane is never active in this state.
Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.
Trigger Reduced
Mode
The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.
Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.
Delete

action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.
Rename
Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Configuring
safety planes
1. In your PolyScope header, tap Installation.
2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Planes.
3. On the top right of the screen, in the Planes field, tap Add plane.
4. On the bottom right of the screen, in the Properties field, set up Name, Copy

If the copied feature is modified in the Features screen, a warning icon appears to the right of
the Copy Feature text. This indicates that the feature is out of sync i.e. the information in the
properties card is not updated to reflect the modifications that may have been made to the
Feature.

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].
Tool Flange
Restriction
Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.
Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.
You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.
Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example
Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.
The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example
In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)
If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction
Description
The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.
NOTICE
Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties
The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:
1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.
2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.
Disabled Tool direction limit
Never active
Normal Tool direction limit
Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit
Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit
Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.
You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.
Tool
Prope
rties
By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:
• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange
• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.
Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction
Description
The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.
• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.
• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.
• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.
Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools
For the user defined tools, the user can change:
• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).
• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.
You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning
You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:
• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.
To configure the tool position
1. In the Header tap Installation.
2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.
3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.
• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.
4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.
5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example
In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.

Description
A program is a list of commands telling the robot what to do. For most tasks,
programming is done entirely using the PolyScope software. PolyScope allows you to
teach the robot arm how to move using a series of waypoints to set up a path for the
robot arm to follow.
Use the Move tab to move the Robot Arm to a desired position, or teach the position by
pulling the Robot Arm into place while holding down the Freedrive button at the top of the
Teach Pendant.
You can create a program can to send I/O signals to other machines at certain points in
the robot’s path, and perform commands like if…then and loop, based on variables and
I/O signals.

To create a
simple
program
1. On PolyScope, in the Header File Path, tap New... and select Program.
2. Under Basic, tap Waypoint to add a waypoint to the program tree. A default MoveJ is
also added to the program tree.
3. Select the new waypoint and in the Command tab, tap Waypoint.
4. On the Move Tool screen, move the robot arm by pressing the move arrows.
You can also move the robot arm by holding down the Freedrive button and pulling the
Robot Arm into desired positions.
5. Once the robot arm is in position, press OK and the new waypoint displays as
Waypoint_1.
6. Follow steps 2 to 5 to create Waypoint_2.
7. Select Waypoint_2 and press the Move Up arrow until it is above Waypoint_1 to
change the order of the movements.
8. Stand clear, hold on to the emergency stop button and in the PolyScope Footer, press
Play button for the Robot Arm to move between Waypoint_1 and Waypoint_2.
Congratulations! You have now produced your first robot program that moves the
Robot Arm between the two given waypoints.
NOTICE
1. Do not drive the robot into itself or anything else as this may cause
damage to the robot.
2. This is only a quick start guide to show how easy it is to use a UR
robot. It assumes a harmless environment and a very careful user.

10.5.6. Using Basic Program Nodes
Description
Basic program nodes are used to create simple robot applications. Some basic program
nodes are also used to organize your robot program and create comments in your robot
program. This can be quite useful, if it is large robot program.
10.5.7. Basic Program Nodes: Move
Description
The Move command allows the robot to move from point A to point B.
How the robot moves is important to the task the robot is performing.
When you add a Move to your program tree, the Move pane appears to the right of the
screen.
The Movecommand controls the robot&#x27;s motion via waypoints.
Waypoints are automatically added when you add Move commands to a program.
Read more about Waypoints.
You can also use Moves to set acceleration and speed for the robot arm&#x27;s movement
between waypoints.
The robot moves using four Move commands. See the Move command types below:
MoveJ
The MoveJ command creates a movement from point A to point B that is optimal for the
robot.
The movement may not be a direct line between A and B, but optimal for the start position of
the joints and the end position of the joints.

Add a MoveJ
command
1. In your robot program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveJ in the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveJ makes movements that are calculated in the robot arm joint space. Joints are
controlled to finish their movements at the same time. This movement type results in a
curved path for the tool to follow. The shared parameters that apply to this movement type
are the maximum joint speed and joint acceleration, specified in deg/s and deg/s2,
respectively. If it is desired to have the robot arm move fast between waypoints,
disregarding the path of the tool between those waypoints, this movement type is the
preferable choice.
MoveL
The MoveL command creates a movement that is a direct line from point A and point B.
Add a MoveL
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveL from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveL moves the Tool Center Point (TCP) linearly between waypoints. This means that
each joint performs a more complicated motion to keep the tool on a straight line path. The
shared parameters that can be set for this movement type are the desired tool speed and
tool acceleration specified in mm/s and mm/s2, respectively, and also a feature.
MoveP
The MoveP command creates a movement with a constant speed between the waypoints.
Blend between waypoints is enabled to ensure constant speed. (See Blending).
Add a MoveP
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with the
Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveP moves the tool linearly with constant speed with circular blends, and is intended for
some process operations, like gluing or dispensing. The size of the blend radius is by
default a shared value between all the waypoints. A smaller value will make the path turn
sharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. While the robot arm is moving
through the waypoints with constant speed, the robot control box cannot wait for either an
I/O operation or an operator action. Doing so might stop the robot arm’s motion, or cause a
robot stop.

MoveCircle
The MoveCircle command creates a circular movement, by creating a half circle.
You can only add CircleMove via a MoveP command.
Add a
MoveCircle
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move.
A waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
5. Tap Add circle move
6. Select the orientation mode.
Detail
The robot starts the circular movement from its current position, or start point, and moves
through a ViaPoint specified on the circular arc, to an EndPoint that completes the circular
movement.
A mode is used to calculate tool orientation, through the circular arc.
The mode can be:
• Fixed: only the start point is used to define the tool orientation.
• Unconstrained: the start point transforms to the EndPoint to define tool orientation.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='002__L1__2._Your_Robot__pp12-27.pdf'><content>2. Your Robot

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Software Safety Restrictions
Description
NOTICE
Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.
Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.
WARNING
Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.
Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es
You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.
Disabled
The safety plane is never active in this state.
Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.
Trigger Reduced
Mode
The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.
Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.
Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.
Rename
Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Configuring
safety planes
1. In your PolyScope header, tap Installation.
2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Planes.
3. On the top right of the screen, in the Planes field, tap Add plane.
4. On the bottom right of the screen, in the Properties field, set up Name, Copy
Feature and Restrictions.
Copy
Feature
In Copy Feature, only Undefined and Base are available. You can reset a configured safety
plane by selecting Undefined
If the copied feature is modified in the Features screen, a warning icon appears to the right of
the Copy Feature text. This indicates that the feature is out of sync i.e. the information in the
properties card is not updated to reflect the modifications that may have been made to the
Feature.

The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].
Tool Flange
Restriction
Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.
Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.
You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.
Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example
Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.
The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example
In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)
If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction
Description
The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.
NOTICE
Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties
The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:
1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.
2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.
Disabled Tool direction limit
Never active
Normal Tool direction limit
Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit
Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit
Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.
You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.
Tool
Prope
rties
By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:
• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange
• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.
Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction
Description
The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.
• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.
• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.
• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.
Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools
For the user defined tools, the user can change:
• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).
• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.
You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning
You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:
• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.
To configure the tool position
1. In the Header tap Installation.
2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.
3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.
• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.
4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.
5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example
In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.
The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.
Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__05__10.5._The_First_Program__pp133-162_part01.pdf'><content>10.5. The First Program
Description
A program is a list of commands telling the robot what to do. For most tasks,
programming is done entirely using the PolyScope software. PolyScope allows you to
teach the robot arm how to move using a series of waypoints to set up a path for the
robot arm to follow.
Use the Move tab to move the Robot Arm to a desired position, or teach the position by
pulling the Robot Arm into place while holding down the Freedrive button at the top of the
Teach Pendant.
You can create a program can to send I/O signals to other machines at certain points in
the robot’s path, and perform commands like if…then and loop, based on variables and
I/O signals.

To create a
simple
program
1. On PolyScope, in the Header File Path, tap New... and select Program.
2. Under Basic, tap Waypoint to add a waypoint to the program tree. A default MoveJ is
also added to the program tree.
3. Select the new waypoint and in the Command tab, tap Waypoint.
4. On the Move Tool screen, move the robot arm by pressing the move arrows.
You can also move the robot arm by holding down the Freedrive button and pulling the
Robot Arm into desired positions.
5. Once the robot arm is in position, press OK and the new waypoint displays as
Waypoint_1.
6. Follow steps 2 to 5 to create Waypoint_2.
7. Select Waypoint_2 and press the Move Up arrow until it is above Waypoint_1 to

10.5.6. Using Basic Program Nodes
Description
Basic program nodes are used to create simple robot applications. Some basic program
nodes are also used to organize your robot program and create comments in your robot
program. This can be quite useful, if it is large robot program.
10.5.7. Basic Program Nodes: Move
Description
The Move command allows the robot to move from point A to point B.
How the robot moves is important to the task the robot is performing.
When you add a Move to your program tree, the Move pane appears to the right of the
screen.
The Movecommand controls the robot&#x27;s motion via waypoints.
Waypoints are automatically added when you add Move commands to a program.
Read more about Waypoints.
You can also use Moves to set acceleration and speed for the robot arm&#x27;s movement
between waypoints.
The robot moves using four Move commands. See the Move command types below:
MoveJ
The MoveJ command creates a movement from point A to point B that is optimal for the
robot.
The movement may not be a direct line between A and B, but optimal for the start position of
the joints and the end position of the joints.

Add a MoveJ
command
1. In your robot program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveJ in the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveJ makes movements that are calculated in the robot arm joint space. Joints are
controlled to finish their movements at the same time. This movement type results in a
curved path for the tool to follow. The shared parameters that apply to this movement type
are the maximum joint speed and joint acceleration, specified in deg/s and deg/s2,
respectively. If it is desired to have the robot arm move fast between waypoints,
disregarding the path of the tool between those waypoints, this movement type is the
preferable choice.
MoveL
The MoveL command creates a movement that is a direct line from point A and point B.
Add a MoveL
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveL from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveL moves the Tool Center Point (TCP) linearly between waypoints. This means that
each joint performs a more complicated motion to keep the tool on a straight line path. The
shared parameters that can be set for this movement type are the desired tool speed and
tool acceleration specified in mm/s and mm/s2, respectively, and also a feature.
MoveP
The MoveP command creates a movement with a constant speed between the waypoints.
Blend between waypoints is enabled to ensure constant speed. (See Blending).
Add a MoveP
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with the
Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveP moves the tool linearly with constant speed with circular blends, and is intended for
some process operations, like gluing or dispensing. The size of the blend radius is by
default a shared value between all the waypoints. A smaller value will make the path turn
sharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. While the robot arm is moving
through the waypoints with constant speed, the robot control box cannot wait for either an
I/O operation or an operator action. Doing so might stop the robot arm’s motion, or cause a
robot stop.

MoveCircle
The MoveCircle command creates a circular movement, by creating a half circle.
You can only add CircleMove via a MoveP command.
Add a
MoveCircle
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move.
A waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
5. Tap Add circle move
6. Select the orientation mode.
Detail
The robot starts the circular movement from its current position, or start point, and moves
through a ViaPoint specified on the circular arc, to an EndPoint that completes the circular
movement.
A mode is used to calculate tool orientation, through the circular arc.
The mode can be:
• Fixed: only the start point is used to define the tool orientation.
• Unconstrained: the start point transforms to the EndPoint to define tool orientation.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='002__L1__2._Your_Robot__pp12-27.pdf'><content>2. Your Robot

About the
robot arm
The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.
About the
manual
This manual contains safety information, guidelines for safe use, and instructions to mount
the robot arm, Control Box and Teach Pendant. You can also find instructions for how to

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Description
Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the
emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.
13.1. Emergency Stop
Description
The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Device
When a Three-Position Enabling Device is used and the robot is in Manual Mode,
movement requires pressing the Three-Position Enabling Device to the center-on
position. The Three-Position Enabling Device has no effect in Automatic Mode.
A 3PE Teach Pendant is recommended for programming. If another person can be within
the safeguarded space when in Manual Mode, an additional device can be integrated and
configured for the additional person&#x27;s use.

13.3.1. Recovery Mode
Description
When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.
During Recovery Mode, the robot arm is moved to be within joint limits, using either
Freedrive or the Move tab in PolyScope.

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.
13.3.2. Backdrive
Description
Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.

Software Safety Restrictions
Description
NOTICE
Configuring planes is entirely based on features. We recommend you
create and name all features before editing the safety configuration, as
the robot is powered off once the Safety Tab has been unlocked and
moving the robot will be impossible.
Safety planes restrict robot workspace. You can define up to eight safety planes,
restricting the robot tool and elbow. You can also restrict elbow movement for each
safety plane and disable by deselecting the checkbox. Before configuring safety planes,
you must define a feature in the robot installation. The feature can then be copied into the
safety plane screen and configured.
WARNING
Defining safety planes only limits the defined Tool spheres and elbow,
not the overall limit for the robot arm. This means that specifying a
safety plane, does not guarantee that other parts of the robot arm will
obey this restriction.
Saf
ety
Pla
nes
Mod
es
You can configure each plane with restrictive Modes using the icons listed below.
Disabled
The safety plane is never active in this state.
Normal
When the safety system is in Normal mode, a normal plane is
active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Reduced
When the safety system is in Reduced mode, a reduced mode
plane is active and it acts as a strict limit on the position.
Normal &amp; Reduced
When the safety system is either in Normal or Reduced mode,
a normal and reduced mode plane is active and acts as a strict
limit on the position.
Trigger Reduced
Mode
The safety plane causes the safety system to switch to
Reduced mode if the robot Tool or Elbow is positioned beyond
it.
Show
Pressing this icon hides or shows the safety plane in the
graphics pane.
Delete
Deletes the created safety plane. There is no undo/redo
action. If a plane is deleted in error, it must be remade.
Rename
Pressing this icon allows you to rename the plane.

Configuring
safety planes
1. In your PolyScope header, tap Installation.
2. In the Side Menu on the left of the screen, tap Safety and select Planes.
3. On the top right of the screen, in the Planes field, tap Add plane.
4. On the bottom right of the screen, in the Properties field, set up Name, Copy
Feature and Restrictions.
Copy
Feature
In Copy Feature, only Undefined and Base are available. You can reset a configured safety
plane by selecting Undefined
If the copied feature is modified in the Features screen, a warning icon appears to the right of
the Copy Feature text. This indicates that the feature is out of sync i.e. the information in the
properties card is not updated to reflect the modifications that may have been made to the
Feature.

UR20 / UR30
0.19 m
The information about the specific radius can be found in the urcontrol.conf file on the robot
under the section [Elbow].
Tool Flange
Restriction
Restricting the tool flange prevents the tool flange and the attached tool from crossing a
safety plane. When you restrict the tool flange, the unrestricted area is the area inside of
the safety plane, where the tool flange can operate normally.
The tool flange cannot cross the restricted area, outside of the safety plane.
Removing the restriction allows the tool flange to go beyond the safety plane, to the
restricted area, while the attached tool remains inside of the safety plane.
You can remove the tool flange restriction when working with a large tool off-set. This will
allow extra distance for the tool to move.
Restricting the tool flange requires the creation of a plane feature. The plane feature is
used to set up a safety plane later in the safety settings.

Adding a
plane feature
example
Displacement offsets the plane in either the positive or negative direction along the plane
normal (Z-axis of the plane feature).
Deselect the checkbox for the Elbow and the Tool Flange so they do not trigger the safety
plane. The Elbow can remain checked as needed by your application.
The unrestricted tool flange can cross a safety plane, even when no tool is defined.
If no tool is added, a warning on the Tool Position button prompts you to correctly define the
tool.
When working with an unrestricted tool flange and a defined tool, it is ensured that the
dangerous part of the tool can&#x27;t go above and/or beyond certain area. The unrestricted tool
flange can be used for any application where safety planes are needed, like Welding or
Assembly.

Tool flange
restriction
example
In this example, an X-Y-plane is created with an offset of 300mm along the positive Z-axis
with reference to the base feature.
The Z-axis of the plane can be thought of as “pointing” towards the restricted area.
If the safety plane is needed on e.g., the surface of a table, rotate the plane 3.142 rad or
180° around either the X- or Y-axis so the restricted area is under the table.
(TIP: Change the display of rotation from “Rotation Vector [rad]” to “RPY [°]”)
If needed it is possible to offset the plane in either positive or negative Z-direction later in
the safety settings.
When satisfied with the position of the plane, tap OK.

10.4.1. Tool Direction Restriction
Description
The Tool Direction screen can be used to restrict the angle in which the tool is pointing.
The limit is defined by a cone that has a fixed orientation with respect to the robot arm
Base. As the robot arm moves around, tool direction is restricted so it remains within the
defined cone. The default direction of the tool coincides with the Z-axis of the tool output
flange. It can be customized by specifying tilt and pan angles.
Before configuring the limit, you must define a point or plane in the robot installation. The
feature can then be copied and its Z axis used as the center of the cone defining the limit.
NOTICE
Configuration of the tool direction is based on features. We recommend
you create desired feature(s) before editing the safety configuration, as
once the Safety Tab has been unlocked, the robot arm powers off
making it impossible to define new features.

Limit
Prope
rties
The Tool Direction limit has three configurable properties:
1. Cone center: You can select a point or plane feature from the drop-down menu, to define
the center of the cone. The Z axis of the selected feature is used as the direction around
which the cone is centred.
2. Cone angle: You can define how many degrees the robot is allowed to deviate from center.
Disabled Tool direction limit
Never active
Normal Tool direction limit
Active only when safety system is in Normal mode
Reduced Tool direction limit
Active only when the safety system is in Reduced mode
Normal &amp; Reduced Tool
direction limit
Active when the safety system is in Normal mode as
well as when it is in Reduced mode.
You can reset the values to default or undo the Tool Direction configuration by setting the copy
feature back to &quot;Undefined&quot;.
Tool
Prope
rties
By default, the tool points in the same direction as the Z axis of the tool output flange. This can be
modified by specifying two angles:
• Tilt angle: How much to tilt the Z axis of the output flange towards the X axis of the output
flange
• Pan angle: How much to rotate the tilted Z axis around the original output flange Z axis.
Alternatively, the Z axis of an existing TCP can be copied by selecting that TCP from the drop-down
menu.

10.4.2. Tool Position Restriction
Description
The Tool Position screen enables more controlled restriction of tools and/or accessories
placed on the end of the robot arm.
• Robot is where you can visualize your modifications.
• Tool is where you can define and configure a tool up to two tools.
• Tool_1 is the default tool defined with values x=0.0, y= 0.0, z=0.0 and radius=0.0.
These values represent the robot tool flange.
Under Copy TCP, you can also select Tool Flange and cause the tool values to go back
to 0.
A default sphere is defined at the tool flange.

User
defined
tools
For the user defined tools, the user can change:
• Radius to change the radius of the tool sphere. The radius is considered when using
safety planes. When a point in the sphere passes a reduced mode trigger plane, the
robot switches to Reduced mode. The safety system prevents any point on the sphere
from passing a safety plane (see Software Safety Restrictions).
• Position to change the position of the tool with respect to the tool flange of the robot.
The position is considered for the safety functions for tool speed, tool force, stopping
distance and safety planes.
You can use an existing Tool Center Point as a base for defining new tool positions. A copy of
the existing TCP, predefined in General menu, in TCP screen, can be accessed in Tool
Position menu, in Copy TCP drop-down list.
When you edit or adjust the values in the Edit Position input fields, the name of the TCP
visible in the drop down menu changes to custom, indicating that there is a difference
between the copied TCP and the actual limit input. The original TCP is still available in the
drop down list and can be selected again to change the values back to the original position.
The selection in the copy TCP drop down menu does not affect the tool name.
Once you apply your Tool Position screen changes, if you try to modify the copied TCP in the
TCP configuration screen, a warning icon appears to the right of the Copy TCP text. This
indicates that the TCP is out of sync i.e. the information in the properties field is not updated
to reflect modifications that may have been made to the TCP. The TCP can be synced by
pressing the sync icon (see ).
The TCP does not have to be synced in order to define and use a tool successfully.
You can rename the tool by pressing the pencil tab next to the displayed tool name. You can
also determine the Radius with an allowed range of 0-300 mm. The limit appears in the
graphics pane as either a point or a sphere depending on radius size.

Tool Position
Warning
You must set a Tool Position within the safety settings, for the safety plane to trigger
correctly when the tool TCP approaches the safety plane.
The warning remains on the Tool Position if:
• You fail to add a new tool under Tool Flange.
To configure the tool position
1. In the Header tap Installation.
2. On the left side of the screen, under Safety, tap Tool Position.
3. On the right side of the screen, select Add Tool.
• The newly added tool has a default name: Tool_x.
4. Tap the edit button to rename Tool_x to something more identifiable.
5. Edit the Radius and Position to match that of the tool you are currently using, or use
the Copy TCP drop-down and choose a TCP from the General&gt;TCP settings if such
is defined.

Tool Position
Warning
example
In this example, a Radius of 0.8mm is set and the TCP position to XYZ [20, 0, 400] in
millimeters respectively. Optionally you can choose to ”Copy TCP” by using the drop-down
menu if one has already been set in the -&gt;General/TCP settings. Once the Apply is tapped
in the bottom right corner of the screen, you are DONE.
The warning on the Tool Position button indicates a tool is not added under Tool Flange.
Tool Position button without the warning indicates a tool (other than the Tool Flange) is
added.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__05__10.5._The_First_Program__pp133-162_part01.pdf'><content>10.5. The First Program
Description
A program is a list of commands telling the robot what to do. For most tasks,
programming is done entirely using the PolyScope software. PolyScope allows you to
teach the robot arm how to move using a series of waypoints to set up a path for the
robot arm to follow.
Use the Move tab to move the Robot Arm to a desired position, or teach the position by
pulling the Robot Arm into place while holding down the Freedrive button at the top of the
Teach Pendant.
You can create a program can to send I/O signals to other machines at certain points in
the robot’s path, and perform commands like if…then and loop, based on variables and
I/O signals.

To create a
simple
program
1. On PolyScope, in the Header File Path, tap New... and select Program.
2. Under Basic, tap Waypoint to add a waypoint to the program tree. A default MoveJ is
also added to the program tree.
3. Select the new waypoint and in the Command tab, tap Waypoint.
4. On the Move Tool screen, move the robot arm by pressing the move arrows.
You can also move the robot arm by holding down the Freedrive button and pulling the
Robot Arm into desired positions.
5. Once the robot arm is in position, press OK and the new waypoint displays as
Waypoint_1.
6. Follow steps 2 to 5 to create Waypoint_2.
7. Select Waypoint_2 and press the Move Up arrow until it is above Waypoint_1 to
change the order of the movements.
8. Stand clear, hold on to the emergency stop button and in the PolyScope Footer, press
Play button for the Robot Arm to move between Waypoint_1 and Waypoint_2.
Congratulations! You have now produced your first robot program that moves the
Robot Arm between the two given waypoints.

10.5.6. Using Basic Program Nodes
Description
Basic program nodes are used to create simple robot applications. Some basic program
nodes are also used to organize your robot program and create comments in your robot
program. This can be quite useful, if it is large robot program.
10.5.7. Basic Program Nodes: Move
Description
The Move command allows the robot to move from point A to point B.
How the robot moves is important to the task the robot is performing.
When you add a Move to your program tree, the Move pane appears to the right of the
screen.
The Movecommand controls the robot&#x27;s motion via waypoints.
Waypoints are automatically added when you add Move commands to a program.
Read more about Waypoints.
You can also use Moves to set acceleration and speed for the robot arm&#x27;s movement
between waypoints.
The robot moves using four Move commands. See the Move command types below:
MoveJ
The MoveJ command creates a movement from point A to point B that is optimal for the
robot.
The movement may not be a direct line between A and B, but optimal for the start position of
the joints and the end position of the joints.

Add a MoveJ
command
1. In your robot program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveJ in the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveJ makes movements that are calculated in the robot arm joint space. Joints are
controlled to finish their movements at the same time. This movement type results in a
curved path for the tool to follow. The shared parameters that apply to this movement type
are the maximum joint speed and joint acceleration, specified in deg/s and deg/s2,
respectively. If it is desired to have the robot arm move fast between waypoints,
disregarding the path of the tool between those waypoints, this movement type is the
preferable choice.
MoveL
The MoveL command creates a movement that is a direct line from point A and point B.
Add a MoveL
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with a Move
node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveL from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveL moves the Tool Center Point (TCP) linearly between waypoints. This means that
each joint performs a more complicated motion to keep the tool on a straight line path. The
shared parameters that can be set for this movement type are the desired tool speed and
tool acceleration specified in mm/s and mm/s2, respectively, and also a feature.
MoveP
The MoveP command creates a movement with a constant speed between the waypoints.
Blend between waypoints is enabled to ensure constant speed. (See Blending).
Add a MoveP
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move to add a waypoint to the robot program together with the
Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
Detail
MoveP moves the tool linearly with constant speed with circular blends, and is intended for
some process operations, like gluing or dispensing. The size of the blend radius is by
default a shared value between all the waypoints. A smaller value will make the path turn
sharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. While the robot arm is moving
through the waypoints with constant speed, the robot control box cannot wait for either an
I/O operation or an operator action. Doing so might stop the robot arm’s motion, or cause a
robot stop.

MoveCircle
The MoveCircle command creates a circular movement, by creating a half circle.
You can only add CircleMove via a MoveP command.
Add a
MoveCircle
command
1. In your Robot Program, select the place where you wish to add a Move.
2. Under Basic, tap Move.
A waypoint is added to the robot program together with the Move node.
3. Select the move node.
4. Select the MoveP from the drop-down menu.
5. Tap Add circle move
6. Select the orientation mode.
Detail
The robot starts the circular movement from its current position, or start point, and moves
through a ViaPoint specified on the circular arc, to an EndPoint that completes the circular
movement.
A mode is used to calculate tool orientation, through the circular arc.
The mode can be:
• Fixed: only the start point is used to define the tool orientation.
• Unconstrained: the start point transforms to the EndPoint to define tool orientation.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='002__L1__2._Your_Robot__pp12-27.pdf'><content>2. Your Robot

About the
robot arm
The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.
About the
manual
This manual contains safety information, guidelines for safe use, and instructions to mount

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Description
Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the
emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.
13.1. Emergency Stop
Description
The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

the safeguarded space when in Manual Mode, an additional device can be integrated and
configured for the additional person&#x27;s use.

13.3.1. Recovery Mode
Description
When a safety limit is exceeded, Recovery Mode is automatically activated, allowing the
robot arm to be moved. Recovery Mode is a type of Manual Mode .
You cannot run robot programs when Recovery Mode is active.

Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery.
13.3.2. Backdrive
Description
Backdrive is a Manual Mode used to force specific joints to a desired position without
releasing all brakes in the robot arm.
This is sometimes necessary if the robot arm is close to collision and the vibrations that
accompany a full restart are not desired.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input

Safety
outputs
For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:
Safety
Output
Description
System
Emergency
Stop
While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger

Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function

Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result></sources>",resp_0f4b3a30150f5c5e00690d3de0a1ec819d845ed425b2ae2d6b,gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,completed,1762475488.0,3298,222,3520,

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be

prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:

Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result></sources>",resp_0e35340886218f1700690d3e00b29481a0bd98ba1d47f5ad4a,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,completed,1762475520.0,3298,121,3419,

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input
Description
Emergency
Stop Button
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using
the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is
initiated in anything connected to the output.
Robot
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) via Control Box input, informing
other machines using the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is
defined.
System
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) on robot only, in all modes and
takes precedence over all other commands.
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in all modes, except when using
a 3-Position Enabling Device and a mode selector - then when in Manual
Mode, the Safeguard Stop can be set to only function in Automatic Mode.
Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in Automatic mode ONLY.
Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop can only be selected when a Three-

Safety
Output
Description
System
Emergency
Stop
While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger

Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function

Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result></sources>",resp_06ab5b84cfb5620100690d3e07c07481a2b879487cb13cc462,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,completed,1762475527.0,3298,398,3696,

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input
Description
Emergency
Stop Button
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using
the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is
initiated in anything connected to the output.
Robot
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) via Control Box input, informing
other machines using the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is
defined.
System
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) on robot only, in all modes and
takes precedence over all other commands.
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in all modes, except when using
a 3-Position Enabling Device and a mode selector - then when in Manual
Mode, the Safeguard Stop can be set to only function in Automatic Mode.
Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in Automatic mode ONLY.
Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop can only be selected when a Three-
Position Enabling Device is configured and installed.
Safeguard
Reset
Returns from the Safeguard Stop state, when a rising edge on the
Safeguard Reset input occurs.
Reduced
Mode
Transitions the safety system to use the Reduced mode limits.
Three-
Position
Enabling
Device
Initiates a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) when the enabling device is fully
pressed or fully released in manual mode only. Three-Position Enabling
Device Stop is triggered when an input goes low. It is unaffected by a
Safeguard Reset.
Freedrive on
robot
Enables freedrive, when the robot is not in Automatic Mode.
Operational
Mode
Switches between Operational modes. The robot is in Automatic mode
when input is low, Manual mode when input is high.
Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Reset
Returns from the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop state, when a rising
edge on the Automatic Mode Safeguard Reset input occurs.

Safety
outputs
For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:
Safety
Output
Description
System
Emergency
Stop
While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger
Reaction
Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit
80 W
The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input
Description
Emergency
Stop Button
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using
the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is
initiated in anything connected to the output.
Robot
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) via Control Box input, informing
other machines using the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is
defined.
System
Emergency
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) on robot only, in all modes and
takes precedence over all other commands.
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in all modes, except when using
a 3-Position Enabling Device and a mode selector - then when in Manual
Mode, the Safeguard Stop can be set to only function in Automatic Mode.
Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Stop
Performs a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) in Automatic mode ONLY.
Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop can only be selected when a Three-
Position Enabling Device is configured and installed.
Safeguard
Reset
Returns from the Safeguard Stop state, when a rising edge on the
Safeguard Reset input occurs.
Reduced
Mode
Transitions the safety system to use the Reduced mode limits.
Three-
Position
Enabling
Device
Initiates a Stop Category 2 (IEC 60204-1) when the enabling device is fully
pressed or fully released in manual mode only. Three-Position Enabling
Device Stop is triggered when an input goes low. It is unaffected by a
Safeguard Reset.
Freedrive on
robot
Enables freedrive, when the robot is not in Automatic Mode.
Operational
Mode
Switches between Operational modes. The robot is in Automatic mode
when input is low, Manual mode when input is high.
Automatic
Mode
Safeguard
Reset
Returns from the Automatic Mode Safeguard Stop state, when a rising
edge on the Automatic Mode Safeguard Reset input occurs.

Safety
outputs
For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:
Safety
Output
Description
System
Emergency
Stop
While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger

Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit
80 W
The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration
Description
This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.
WARNING
Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.
1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.
2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.
3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.
4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.
5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.
See Hardware Installation Manual.

conducted by the integrator.
Recommended
procedure for the
integrator:
To change the safety configuration
1. Verify that changes comply with the risk assessment conducted by the integrator.
2. Adjust safety settings to the appropriate level defined by the risk assessment
conducted by the integrator.
3. Verify that the settings are applied.
4. Place following text in the operators’ manuals:
Before working near the robot, make sure that the safety configuration is as expected.
This can be verified e.g. by inspecting the Safety Checksum in the top right corner of
PolyScope for any changes. (See Safety Checksum).

10.3.3. Applying a New Software Safety Configuration
Description
The robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.
Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.
Safety Checksum
Description
The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.
It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.
The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.



10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant
Description
You can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach
Pendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the
Teach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.
CAUTION
If the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the
Emergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the
Teach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.
To safely

2. In the Side Menu on left tap Safety and select Hardware.
3. Input Safety password and Unlock the screen.
4. Deselect Teach Pendant to use robot without PolyScope interface.
5. Press Save and restart to implement changes.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force
Limits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position
Description
Safe Home is a return position defined by using the user-defined Home Position.
Safe Home I/Os are active when the Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position and a Safe

around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger
Reaction
Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2

NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit
80 W
The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration
Description
This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.
WARNING
Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.
1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.
2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.
3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.
4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.
5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.
The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.



10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant
Description
You can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach
Pendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the
Teach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.
CAUTION
If the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the
Emergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the
Teach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.

5. Press Save and restart to implement changes.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force
Limits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position
Description
Safe Home is a return position defined by using the user-defined Home Position.
Safe Home I/Os are active when the Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position and a Safe
Home I/O is defined.
The Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position if the joint positions are at the specified joint

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace

Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force
Limits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position

The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

inertia
You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input

While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger
Reaction
Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit
80 W
The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration
Description
This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.
WARNING
Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.
1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.
2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.
3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.
4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.
5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

Description
Changes to the Safety Configuration settings must comply with the risk assessment
conducted by the integrator.
Recommended
procedure for the
integrator:
To change the safety configuration
1. Verify that changes comply with the risk assessment conducted by the integrator.
2. Adjust safety settings to the appropriate level defined by the risk assessment
conducted by the integrator.
3. Verify that the settings are applied.
4. Place following text in the operators’ manuals:
Before working near the robot, make sure that the safety configuration is as expected.
This can be verified e.g. by inspecting the Safety Checksum in the top right corner of
PolyScope for any changes. (See Safety Checksum).

10.3.3. Applying a New Software Safety Configuration
Description
The robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.
Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.
Safety Checksum
Description
The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.
It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.
The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.



10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant
Description
You can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach
Pendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the
Teach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.
CAUTION
If the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the
Emergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the
Teach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force
Limits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position
Description
Safe Home is a return position defined by using the user-defined Home Position.
Safe Home I/Os are active when the Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position and a Safe
Home I/O is defined.

The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

inertia
You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

2.4.1. Icons/Tabs On PolyScope
Description
The following section lists and defines the icons/tabs and buttons in the PolyScope
interface.
Header Icons /
Functions
Run is a simple means of operating the robot using pre-written programs.

Description
Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the
emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.
13.1. Emergency Stop
Description
The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

Description
This section provides information to help you strengthen the robot against potential
cybersecurity threats. It outlines requirements for addressing cybersecurity threats and
provides security hardening guidelines.
11.1. General Cybersecurity
Description
Connecting a Universal Robots robot to a network can introduce cybersecurity risks.
These risks can be mitigated by using qualified personnel and implementing specific
measures for protecting the robot&#x27;s cybersecurity.
Implementing cybersecurity measures requires conducting a cybersecurity threat
assessment.
The purpose is to:
• Identify threats
• Define trust zones and conduits
• Specify the requirements of each component in the application
WARNING
Failure to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment can place the robot
at risk.
• The integrator or competent, qualified personnel shall conduct a
cybersecurity risk assessment.
NOTICE
Only competent, qualified personnel shall be responsible for
determining the need for specific cybersecurity measures and for
providing the required cybersecurity measures.
11.2. Cybersecurity Requirements
Description
Configuring your network and securing your robot requires you to implement the threat
measures for cybersecurity.
Follow all the requirements before you start configure your network, then verify the robot
setup is secure.

Cybersecurity
• Operating personnel must have a thorough understanding of general
cybersecurity principles and advanced technologies as used in the UR robot.
• Physical security measures must be implemented to allow only authorized
personnel physical access to the robot.
• There must be adequate control of all access points. For example: locks on
doors, badge systems, physical access control in general.
WARNING
Connecting the robot to a network that is not properly secured, can
introduce security and safety risks.
• Only connect your robot to a trusted and properly secured
network.
Network
configuration
requirements
• Only trusted devices are to be connected to the local network.
• There must be no inbound connections from adjacent networks to the robot.
• Outgoing connections from the robot are to be restricted to allow the smallest
relevant set of specific ports, protocols and addresses.
• Only URCaps and magic scripts from trusted partners can be used, and only
after verifying their authenticity and integrity
Robot setup
security
requirements
• Change the default password to a new, strong password.
• Disable the &quot;Magic Files&quot; when not actively used (PolyScope 5).
• Disable SSH access when not needed. Prefer key-based authentication over
password-based authentication
• Set the robot firewall to the most restrictive usable settings and disable all
unused interfaces and services, close ports and restrict IP addresses

11.3. Cybersecurity Hardening Guidelines
Description
Although PolyScope includes many features for keeping the network connection secure,
you can harden security by observing to following guidelines:
• Before connecting your robot to any network, always change the default password
to a strong password.
NOTICE
You cannot retrieve or reset a forgotten or lost password.
• Store all passwords securely.
• Use the built-in settings to restrict the network access to the robot as much as
possible.
• Some communication interfaces have no method of authenticating and encrypting
communication. This is a security risk. Consider appropriate mitigating measures,
based on your cybersecurity threat assessment.
• SSH tunneling (Local port forwarding) must be used to access robot interfaces
from other devices if the connection crosses the trust zone boundary.
• Remove sensitive data from the robot before it is decommissioned. Pay particular
attention to the URCaps and data in the program folder.
• To ensure secure removal of highly sensitive data, securely wipe or destroy
the SD card.
For information about setting an admin password and local port forwarding, see the
Hamburger Menu.
You can also read Secure Setup on www.universal-robots.com/articles

11.4. Passwords

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input

Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger

NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit

The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration
Description
This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.
WARNING
Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.
1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.
2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.
3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.
4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.
5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.
See Hardware Installation Manual.

10.3.2. Changing the Software Safety Configuration
Description
Changes to the Safety Configuration settings must comply with the risk assessment
conducted by the integrator.
Recommended
procedure for the
integrator:
To change the safety configuration
1. Verify that changes comply with the risk assessment conducted by the integrator.
2. Adjust safety settings to the appropriate level defined by the risk assessment
conducted by the integrator.
3. Verify that the settings are applied.
4. Place following text in the operators’ manuals:
Before working near the robot, make sure that the safety configuration is as expected.
This can be verified e.g. by inspecting the Safety Checksum in the top right corner of
PolyScope for any changes. (See Safety Checksum).

10.3.3. Applying a New Software Safety Configuration
Description
The robot is powered off while you make changes to the configuration.
Your changes only take effect after you tap the Apply button.
The robot cannot be powered on again until you select Apply and Restart to visually
inspect your robot Safety Configuration which, for safety reasons, is displayed in SI Units
in a popup.
You can select Revert Changes to return to the previous configuration. When your
visual inspection is complete you can select Confirm Safety Configuration and the
changes are automatically saved as part of the current robot installation.
Safety Checksum
Description
The Safety Checksum icon displays your applied robot safety configuration.
It could be four or eight digits.
A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.
The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.



10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant
Description
You can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach
Pendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the
Teach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.
CAUTION
If the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the
Emergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the
Teach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.
To safely
remove the
Teach
Pendant
The robot can be used without PolyScope as the programming interface.
To configure the robot without a Teach Pendant

3. Input Safety password and Unlock the screen.
4. Deselect Teach Pendant to use robot without PolyScope interface.
5. Press Save and restart to implement changes.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force
Limits maximum force that the elbow exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position
Description
Safe Home is a return position defined by using the user-defined Home Position.
Safe Home I/Os are active when the Robot Arm is in the Safe Home Position and a Safe
Home I/O is defined.

The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

inertia
You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Safety-related Functions and Interfaces
Description
Universal Robots robots are equipped with a range of built-in safety functions as well as
safety I/O, digital and analog control signals to or from the electrical interface, to connect
to other machines and additional protective devices. Each safety function and I/O is
constructed according to EN ISO13849-1 (see Certifications) with Performance Level d
(PLd) using a category 3 architecture.
See Software Safety Configuration for configuration of the safety functions, inputs and
outputs in the user interface. See Safety I/O for descriptions on how to connect safety
devices to I/O.
WARNING
The use of safety configuration parameters different from those
determined as necessary for risk reduction, can result in hazards that
are not reasonably eliminated, or risks that are not sufficiently reduced.
• Ensure tools and grippers are connected correctly to avoid
hazards due to interruption of power.
WARNING: ELECTRICITY
Programmer and/or wiring errors can cause the voltage to change from
12V to 24V leading to fire damage to equipment.
• Verify the use of 12V and proceed with caution.
Additional
Information
NOTICE
• The use and configuration of safety functions and interfaces must
follow the risk assessment procedures for each robot application.
(see chapter Safety section Safety-related Functions and
Interfaces)
• The stopping time should be taken into account as part of the
application risk assessment
• If the robot detects a fault or violation in the safety system (e.g. if
one of the wires in the Emergency Stop circuit is cut or a safety
limit is exceeded), then a Stop Category 0 is initiated.
NOTICE
The end effector is not protected by the UR safety system. The
functioning of the end effector and/or connection cable is not monitored

10.2.1. Configurable Safety Functions
Description
Universal Robots robot safety functions, as listed in the table below, are in the robot but
are meant to control the robot system i.e. the robot with its attached tool/end effector.
The robot safety functions are used to reduce robot system risks determined by the risk
assessment. Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.
Safety
Function
Description
Joint Position
Limit
Sets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.
Joint Speed
Limit
Sets an upper limit for joint speed.
Safety
Planes
Defines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit
either the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the
elbow.
Tool
Orientation
Defines allowable orientation limits for the tool.
Speed Limit
Limits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the
tool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end
effector positions.
Force Limit
Limits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow
in clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,
elbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.
Momentum
Limit
Limits maximum momentum of the robot.
Power Limit
Limits mechanical work performed by the robot.
Stopping
Time Limit
Limits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a robot stop is
initiated.1
Stopping
Distance
Limit
Limits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a robot stop is
initiated.
Safety
Function
When performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the
motion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety
functions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.
These safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can
always be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the
tool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account
i.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.
The functional safety can be summarized as:
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective stop&quot;.

Warnings
CAUTION
Failure to configure the maximum speed limit can result in hazardous
situations.
• If the robot is used in manual hand-guiding applications with linear
movements, the speed limit must be set to maximum 250 mm/s for
the tool/end effector and elbow unless a risk assessment shows
that higher speeds are acceptable. This will prevent fast
movements of the robot elbow near singularities.
NOTICE
There are two exceptions to the force limiting function that are important
when designing an application.
As the robot stretches out, the knee-joint effect can give high forces in the
radial direction (away from the base) at low speeds. Similarly, the short
leverage arm, when the tool/end effector is close to the base and moving
around the base, can cause high forces at low speeds.

Workspace
Front
Tilted
Due to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention
regarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1
joint is at least 450 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm
of the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.
Placing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can lead to injury.

Safety
inputs
The robot also has the following safety inputs:
Safety Input
Description
Emergency
Stop Button
Performs a Stop Category 1 (IEC 60204-1) informing other machines using
the System Emergency Stop output, if that output is defined. A stop is
initiated in anything connected to the output.
Robot

Safety
outputs
For interfacing with other machines, the robot is equipped with the following safety outputs:
Safety
Output
Description
System
Emergency
Stop
While this signal is logic low, the Robot Emergency Stop input is logic low
or the Emergency Stop button is pressed.
Robot
Moving
While this signal is logic high, no single joint of the robot moves more than
0.1 rad/s.
Robot Not
Stopping
Logic high when the robot is stopped or in the process of stopping due to
an Emergency Stop or Safeguard Stop. Otherwise it will be logic low.
Reduced
Logic low when the safety system is in Reduced Mode.
Not Reduced
Logic low when the system is not in Reduced Mode.
Safe Home
Logic high when robot is in the configured Safe Home Position.
All safety I/O are dual channel, meaning they are safe when low (e.g., the Emergency Stop is
active when the signals are low).
10.2.2. Safety Functions
Description
The safety system acts by monitoring if any of the safety limits are exceeded or if an
Emergency Stop or a Safeguard Stop is initiated.
The reactions of the safety system are:
Trigger

Emergency Stop
Stop Category 1
Safeguard Stop
Stop Category 2
3PE Stop (if a 3-Position Enabling device is connected)
Stop Category 2
Limit Violation
Stop Category 0
Fault Detection
Stop Category 0
NOTICE
If the safety system detects any fault or violation, all safety outputs re-
set to low.

10.2.3. Safety Parameter Set
Description
The safety system has the following set of configurable safety parameters:
• Normal
• Reduced
Normal and
Reduced
You can set up the safety limits for each set of safety parameters, creating distinct
configurations for normal, or higher settings, and reduced. The reduced configuration is
active when the tool/end effector is positioned on the reduced side of a Trigger Reduced
Plane, or when the reduced configuration is externally triggered by a safety input.
Using a plane to trigger the Reduced configuration: When the robot arm moves from the
side of the trigger plane configured with reduced safety parameters, to the side that is
configured with normal safety parameters, there is a 20 mm area around the trigger plane
where both normal and reduced limits are allowed. This area around the trigger plane
prevents nuisance safety stops when the robot is exactly at the limit.
Using an input to trigger the Reduced configuration: When a safety input starts, or stops,
the reduced configuration, up to 500 ms can elapse before the new limit values become
active. This can happen in either of the following circumstances:
• Switching from the reduced configuration to normal
• Switching from the normal configuration to reduced
The robot arm adapts to the new safety limits within the 500 ms.

Recovery
When a safety limit is exceeded, the safety system must be restarted. For example, if a joint
position limit is outside a safety limit, at start-up, Recovery is activated.
You cannot run programs for the robot when recovery is activated, but the robot arm can be
manually moved back within limits using Freedrive, or by using the Move tab in PolyScope.
The safety limits for Recovery are:
Safety Function
Limit
Joint Speed Limit
30 °/s
Speed Limit
250 mm/s
Force Limit
100 N
Momentum Limit
10 kg m/s
Power Limit
80 W
The safety system issues a Stop Category 0 if a violation of these limits appears.
WARNING
Failure to use caution when moving the robot arm in recovery mode can
lead to hazardous situations.
• Use caution when moving the robot arm back within the limits, as
limits for the joint positions, the safety planes, and the tool/end
effector orientation are all disabled in recovery mode.</content></result><result file_id='' filename='010__L1__10._First_Time_Use__pp98-164__L2__03__10.3._Software_Safety_Configuration__pp107-120.pdf'><content>10.3. Software Safety Configuration
Description
This section covers how to access the robot safety settings. It is made up of items that
help you set up the robot Safety Configuration.
WARNING
Before you configure your robot safety settings, your integrator must
conduct a risk assessment to guarantee the safety of personnel and
equipment around the robot. A risk assessment is an evaluation of all
work procedures throughout the robot lifetime, conducted in order to
apply correct safety configuration settings. You must set the following
in accordance with the integrator’s risk assessment.
1. The integrator must prevent unauthorized persons from
changing the safety configuration e.g. installing password
protection.
2. Use and configuration of the safety-related functions and
interfaces for a specific robot application.
3. Safety configuration settings for set-up and teaching before the
robot arm is powered on for the first time.
4. All safety configuration settings accessible on this screen and
sub-tabs.
5. The integrator must ensure that all changes to the safety
configuration settings comply with the risk assessment.

A four-digit Checksum should be read from top to bottom and left to right, while an eight-
digit Checksum is read left to right, top row first. Different text and/or colors indicate
changes to the applied safety configuration.
The Safety Checksum changes if you change the Safety Functions settings, because
the Safety Checksum is only generated by the safety settings.
You must apply your changes to the Safety Configuration for the Safety Checksum to
reflect your changes.



10.3.4. Safety Configuration without Teach Pendant
Description
You can use the robot without attaching the Teach Pendant. Removing the Teach
Pendant requires defining another Emergency Stop source. You must specify if the
Teach Pendant is attached to avoid triggering a safety violation.
CAUTION
If the Teach Pendant is detached or disconnected from the robot, the
Emergency Stop button is no longer active. You must remove the
Teach Pendant from the vicinity of the robot.

10.3.5. Software Safety Modes
Description
Under normal conditions, i.e. when no robot stop is in effect, the safety system operates
in a Safety Mode associated with a set of safety limits 1:
• Normal mode is the safety mode that is active by default
• Reduced mode is active when the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) is positioned
beyond a Trigger Reduced mode plane (see Software Safety Restrictions), or
when triggered using a configurable input.
• Recovery mode activates when a safety limit from the active limit set is violated,
the robot arm performs a Stop Category 0. If an active safety limit, such as a joint
position limit or a safety boundary, is violated already when the robot arm is
powered on, it starts up in Recovery mode. This makes it possible to move the
robot arm back within the safety limits. While in Recovery mode, the movement of
the robot arm is restricted by a fixed limit that you cannot customize.
WARNING
Limits for joint position, tool position and tool orientation are disabled
in Recovery mode, so take caution when moving the robot arm back
within the limits.
The menu of the Safety Configuration screen enables the user to define separate sets of
safety limits for Normal and Reduced mode. For the tool and joints, Reduced mode limits
for speed and momentum are required to be more restrictive than their Normal mode
counterparts.
10.3.6. Software Safety Limits
Description
In the Safety Configuration the safety system limits are specified. The Safety System
receives the values from the input fields and detects any violation if any these values are
exceeded. The robot controller attempts to prevent any violations by making a robot stop
or by reducing the speed.
Robot Limits
Description
Robot Limits restrict general robot movements. The Robot Limits screen has two
configuration options: Factory Presets and Custom.
1Robot stop was previously known as &quot;Protective Stop&quot; for Universal Robots robots.

Factory
Presets
Factory Presets is where you can use the slider to select a predefined safety setting . The
values in the table are updated to reflect the preset values ranging from Most Restricted to
Least Restricted
NOTICE
Slider values are only suggestions and do not substitute a proper risk
assessment.

Custom
Custom is where you can set Limits on how the robot functions and monitor the associated
Tolerance.
Power
Limits maximum mechanical work produced by the robot in the
environment. This limit considers the payload a part of the robot and
not of the environment.
Momentum
Limits maximum robot momentum.
Stopping
Time
Limits maximum time it takes the robot to stop e.g. when an
emergency stop is activated.
Stopping
Distance
Limits maximum distance the robot tool or elbow can travel while
stopping.
NOTICE
Restricting stopping time and distance affect overall
robot speed. For example, if stopping time is set to
300 ms, the maximum robot speed is limited
allowing the robot to stop within 300 ms.
Tool Speed
Limits maximum robot tool speed.
Tool Force
Limits maximum force that the robot tool exerts on the environment to
prevent clamping situations.
Elbow Speed
Limits maximum robot elbow speed.
Elbow Force

prevent clamping situations.

The tool speed and force are limited at the tool flange and the center of the two user-defined tool
positions, (see Tool Position Restriction).
NOTICE
You can switch back to Factory Presets for all robot limits to reset to their
default settings.
Joint Limits
Description
Joint limits allow you to restrict individual robot joint movements in joint space i.e. joint
rotational position and joint rotational speed. Joint limiting can also be called software
based axis limiting. The joint limit options are: Maximum speed and Position range.



10.3.7. Safe Home Position

The Joints, Base and Tool Flange are the main components of the robot arm. The controller
coordinates joint motion to move the robot arm.
Attaching an end effector (tool) to the Tool Flange at the end of the robot arm, allows the robot
to manipulate a workpiece. Some tools have a specific purpose beyond manipulating a part,
for example, QC inspection, applying adhesives and welding.
1.1:  The main components of the robot arm.
• Base: where the robot arm is mounted.
• Shoulder and Elbow: make larger movements.
• Wrist 1 and Wrist 2: make finer movements.
• Wrist 3: where the tool is attached to the Tool Flange.
The robot is partly completed machinery, as such a Declaration of Incorporation is provided. A
risk assessment is required for each robot application.
About the
manual
This manual contains safety information, guidelines for safe use, and instructions to mount
the robot arm, Control Box and Teach Pendant. You can also find instructions for how to
begin to install and how to start programming the robot.

2.2. Maximum Payload
Description
The rated robot arm payload depends on the center of gravity (CoG) offset of the
payload, as shown below. The CoG offset is defined as the distance from the center of
the tool flange to the center of gravity of the attached payload.
The robot arm can accommodate a long center of gravity offset, if the payload is placed
below the tool flange. For example when computing the payload mass in a pick and
place application, consider both the gripper and the workpiece.
The robot&#x27;s capacity to accelerate can be reduced if the payload CoG exceeds the
robot&#x27;s reach and payload. You can verify the reach and payload of your robot in the
Technical Specifications.

You can configure payloads with high inertia, if the payload is set correctly.
The controller software automatically adjusts accelerations when the following parameters
are correclty configured:
• Payload mass
• Center of gravity
• Inertia
You can use the URSim to evaluate the accelerations and cycle times of the robot motions
with a specific payload.
2.3. Stopping Time and Stopping Distance
Description
NOTICE
You can set user-defined safety rated maximum stopping time and
distance.
If user-defined settings are used, the program speed is dynamically
adjusted to always comply with the selected limits.
The graphical data provided for Joint 0 (base), Joint 1 (shoulder) and Joint 2 (elbow) is
valid for stopping distance and stopping time:
• Category 0
• Category 1
• Category 2
The Joint 0 test was carried out using a horizontal movement, where the rotational axis
was perpendicular to the ground. For the Joint 1 and Joint 2 tests, the robot followed a
vertical trajectory, where the rotational axes were parallel to the ground, and the stop
was done while the robot was moving downward.
The Y-axis is the distance from where the stop is initiated to the final position.
The payload CoG is at the tool flange.

2.4. PolyScope Overview
Description
PolyScope is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the Teach Pendant that operates
the robot arm via a touch screen. You create, load and execute programs for the robot in
PolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:
• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.
• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.
• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.
Using the
Touch
Screen
The touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent
unexpected motion of the robot.
The Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike
consumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to
environmental factors such as:
• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets
• radio wave emissions
• other conducted noise from the operating environment.
For best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.
In this manual, this is referred to as a &quot;tap&quot;.
A commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.

Description
Follow the instructions here to handle emergency situations, such as activating the
emergency stop using the red push-button. This section also describes how to manually
move the system without power.
13.1. Emergency Stop
Description
The Emergency Stop or E-stop is the red push-button located on the Teach Pendant.
Press the emergency stop push-button to stop all robot motion. Activating the
emergency stop push-button causes a stop category one (IEC 60204-1).
Emergency stops are not safeguards (ISO 12100).
Emergency stops are complementary protective measures that do not prevent injury.
The risk assessment of the robot application determines if additional emergency stop
push-buttons are required. The emergency stop function and the actuating device must
comply with ISO 13850.
After an emergency stop is actuated, the push-button latches in that setting. As such,
each time an emergency stop is activated, it must be manually reset at the push-button
that initiated the stop.
Before resetting the emergency stop push-button, you must visually identify and assess
the reason the E-stop was first activated. Visual assessment of all the equipment in the
application is required. Once the problem is solved, reset the emergency stop push-
button.
To reset the emergency stop push-button
1. Hold the push-button and twist clockwise until the latching disengages.
You should feel when the latching is disengaged, indicating the push-button is
reset.
2. Verify the situation and whether to reset the emergency stop.
3. After resetting the emergency stop, restore power to the robot and resume
operation.

13.2. Movement Without Drive Power
Description
In the unlikely event of an emergency, when powering the robot is either impossible or
unwanted, you can use forced back-driving to move the robot arm.
To perform forced back-driving you must push, or pull, the robot arm hard to move the
joint. Each joint brake has a friction clutch that enables movement during high forced
torque.
Performing forced back-driving requires high force and cannot be performed by one
person alone. In clamping situations, two or more people are required to do the forced
back-driving. In some situations, two or more people are required to disassemble the
robot arm.
See the Service Manual for information about how to disassemble the robot.
WARNING
Risks due to an unsupported robot arm breaking or falling can cause
injury or death.
• Support the robot arm before removing power.
NOTICE
Moving the robot arm manually is intended for emergency and service
purposes only. Unnecessary moving of the robot arm can lead to
property damage.
• Do not move the joint more than 160 degrees, to ensure the
robot can find its original physical position.
• Do not move any joint more than necessary.

13.3. Modes
Description
You access and activate different modes using Teach Pendant or the Dashboard
Server. If an external mode selector is integrated, it control the modes - not PolyScope or
the Dashboard Server.
Automatic Mode Once activated, the robot can only execute a program of pre-defined
tasks. You cannot modify or save programs and installations.
Manual Mode Once activated, you can program the robot. You can modify and save
programs and installations.
High Speed Manual Mode can be used. It allows both tool speed and elbow speed to
temporarily exceed 250 mm/s, while a hold-to-run is used.
Hold-to-run is performed by continuous contact with the Speed Slider.
The robot performs a Safeguard Stop in Manual mode, if a Three-Position Enabling
Device is configured, and either released (not pressed) or it is fully compressed.
Switching between Automatic mode to Manual mode requires the Three-Position
Enabling Device to be fully released and pressed again to allow the robot to move.
When using High Speed Manual Mode, use safety joint limits (see Joint Limits) or safety
planes (see Safety Planes) to restrict the robot’s moving space.

• Operating personnel must have a thorough understanding of general
cybersecurity principles and advanced technologies as used in the UR robot.
• Physical security measures must be implemented to allow only authorized
personnel physical access to the robot.
• There must be adequate control of all access points. For example: locks on
doors, badge systems, physical access control in general.
WARNING
Connecting the robot to a network that is not properly secured, can
introduce security and safety risks.
• Only connect your robot to a trusted and properly secured
network.
Network
configuration
requirements
• Only trusted devices are to be connected to the local network.
• There must be no inbound connections from adjacent networks to the robot.
• Outgoing connections from the robot are to be restricted to allow the smallest
relevant set of specific ports, protocols and addresses.
• Only URCaps and magic scripts from trusted partners can be used, and only
after verifying their authenticity and integrity
Robot setup
security
requirements
• Change the default password to a new, strong password.
• Disable the &quot;Magic Files&quot; when not actively used (PolyScope 5).
• Disable SSH access when not needed. Prefer key-based authentication over
password-based authentication
• Set the robot firewall to the most restrictive usable settings and disable all
unused interfaces and services, close ports and restrict IP addresses

11.3. Cybersecurity Hardening Guidelines
Description
Although PolyScope includes many features for keeping the network connection secure,
you can harden security by observing to following guidelines:
• Before connecting your robot to any network, always change the default password
to a strong password.
NOTICE
You cannot retrieve or reset a forgotten or lost password.
• Store all passwords securely.
• Use the built-in settings to restrict the network access to the robot as much as
possible.
• Some communication interfaces have no method of authenticating and encrypting
communication. This is a security risk. Consider appropriate mitigating measures,
based on your cybersecurity threat assessment.
• SSH tunneling (Local port forwarding) must be used to access robot interfaces
from other devices if the connection crosses the trust zone boundary.
• Remove sensitive data from the robot before it is decommissioned. Pay particular
attention to the URCaps and data in the program folder.
• To ensure secure removal of highly sensitive data, securely wipe or destroy
the SD card.
For information about setting an admin password and local port forwarding, see the
Hamburger Menu.

11.4. Passwords
Description
You can create and manage different types of password in PolyScope. An initial
password must be set to access the full safety settings. The following password types
are described below:
• Administrator
• Operational
11.5. Password Settings
To set a

outside of the Safety menu.

11.6. Administrator Password
Description
Use the Administrator (Admin) Password to change the security configuration of the
system, including network access.
The Admin password is equal to the password used for the root user account on the
Linux system running on the robot, which may be needed in some network use cases
such as SSH or SFTP.
WARNING
You cannot recover a lost Admin password.
• Take the appropriate steps to ensure your admin password is
not lost.
To set the
Admin
Password
1. In the Header, tap the Hamburger menu icon and select Settings.
2. Under Password, tap Admin.
3. Under Current password, put in the default password: easybot.
4. Under New password, create a new password.
Creating a strong, secret password obtains the best security for your system.
5. Under Confirm new password, repeat your new password.
6. Tap Apply to confirm your password change.
Safety
The Safety password prevents unauthorized modification of the Safety settings.

11.7. Operational Password
Description
The Operational Mode Password, or mode password, creates two different user roles on
PolyScope:
• Manual
• Automatic
When the mode password is set, programs and installations can only be created and
edited in Manual mode. Automatic mode only allows the operator to load pre-made
programs . Once a password has been set, a new Mode icon appears in the Header.
Switching operational modes, from Manual to Automatic and from Automatic to Manual,
causes PolyScope to prompt for the new password.
To set the
Mode
Password
1. In the Header, tap the Hamburger menu icon and select Settings.
